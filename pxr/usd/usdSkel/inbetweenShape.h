/// Schema wrapper for UsdAttribute for authoring and introspecting attributes
/// that serve as inbetween shapes of a UsdSkelBlendShape.
///
/// Inbetween shapes allow an explicit shape to be specified when the blendshape
/// to which it's bound is evaluated at a certain weight. For example, rather
/// than performing piecewise linear interpolation between a primary shape and
/// the rest shape at weight 0.5, an inbetween shape could be defined at the
/// weight. For weight values greater than 0.5, a shape would then be resolved
/// by linearly interpolating between the inbetween shape and the primary
/// shape, while for weight values less than or equal to 0.5, the shape is
/// resolved by linearly interpolating between the inbetween shape and the
/// primary shape.
