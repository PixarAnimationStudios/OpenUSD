\page UsdSkel_SchemaOverview Schema Intro By Example

This page provides an overview of the UsdSkel schemas, using several 
scene description examples. The examples here only deal with the scene description
itself. For coding examples, see the \ref UsdSkel_API_Intro "API Introduction"
page. For a more an more in-depth look at the schemas themselves, see the
\ref UsdSkel_Schemas page.

\section UsdSkel_SchemaOverview_SkinningAnArm Skinning an Arm

The following example demonstrates a 3-joint, skinned arm,
with an animation that rotates the elbow by 90 degrees, over 10 frames:

\include ./skinnedArm.usda

We will proceed to break this down one piece at a time.

\subsection UsdSkel_SchemaOverview_SkelRoot Skinning an Arm: The Skel Root

\dontinclude ./skinnedArm.usda
\skip SkelRoot
\until {


When a model (or other grouping of prims) contains skinned data, it must be
encapsulated within a UsdSkelRoot primitive. This serves two purposes:

1. Informs applications that are consuming the file that a branch of the scene
  graph contains skinned primitives, as such data often requires special
  processing by the consuming application.

2. Provides a place to encode pre-computed bounding information for the skinned
  primitives (a UsdSkelRoot is a subclass of `UsdGeomBoundable`). This allows
  renderers to determine where in space the result of skinning resides without
  having to apply skinning first. For example, a renderer is capable of
  efficiently culling objects that are not visible in camera without paying
  the cost of computing skinning.

Secondly, we see that the UsdSkelBindingAPI schema has been applied to the prim.
This informs the runtime that skel-related data is being specified on the prim.
"skel-related data" includes binding SkelAnimation or Skeleton prims, 
BlendShapes, or specifying skel weighting or joint influences primvars.

\subsection UsdSkel_SchemaOverview_DefiningSkeletons Skinning an Arm: Defining a Skeleton

\skip Skeleton
\until joints

A Skeleton encodes a joint hierarchy. The actual joints and their parent<->child
relationships are encoded in a compact, vectorized token array. Each token in
the array is the token-valued form of a relative path to that joint. The paths
follow the same syntax rules as other prim paths in USD, and may be
constructed using the `SdfPath` API.

The tokens authored for _joints_ may be considered as defining the *topology*
of the Skeleton.

Each joint's parent is identified by path. If an intermediate path is excluded,
then the next nearest ancestor path that is included is used instead.
For example, if the joint list above did not include `Shoulder/Elbow`, then the
parent of `Shoulder/Elbow/Hand` would be `Shoulder`. Consumers of UsdSkel
files are encouraged to use the UsdSkelTopology utility class to reason about
these relationships.

Note that it is _valid_ to have multiple root joints in a Skeleton. For example:

\code
def Skeleton "Skel" {
    uniform token[] joints = ["RootA", "RootA/Child", "RootB"]
    ...
}
\endcode

This is allowed because some of the applications that UsdSkel interchanges with
also allow it. In a way, the Skeleton primitive itself may be thought of as the
true root of the Skeleton.

\subsubsection UsdSkel_SchemaOverview_DefiningSkeletons_BindTransforms Bind Transforms

\dontinclude ./skinnedArm.usda
\skipline Skeleton
\skip bindTransforms
\until ]
\until ]


The _bindTransforms_ property of a Skeleton provides the *world space* transform
of each joint at bind time. A world space encoding has been chosen for bind
transforms, since most DCC apps tend to use the same encoding, so using the
same encoding tends to simplify IO.

The entries of the _bindTransforms_ array are ordered according to the order of
the _joints_ attribute. So for this example, the first entry in the array
corresponds to joint `Shoulder`, the second to `Shoulder/Elbow`, and so forth.

\subsubsection UsdSkel_SchemaOverview_DefiningSkeletons_RestTransforms Rest Transforms

\dontinclude ./skinnedArm.usda
\skipline Skeleton
\skip restTransforms
\until ]
\until ]

The _restTransforms_ property of a Skeleton provides *local space* rest
transforms of each joint, which serve as a fallback values for joints that
have not been overridden by an animation. As with _bindTransforms_, the
_restTransforms_ are ordered according to the order of the _joints_ attribute.

The _restTransforms_ may be considered optional, but if left unspecified,
the Skeleton must be bound to a *complete*, non-sparse animation.
It is common for the _restTransforms_ to refer to the same pose as the
_bindTransforms_, only in joint-local space, rather than world space, but this
is not required.

\sa \ref UsdSkel_Skeleton

\subsection UsdSkel_SchemaOverview_SkelAnimations Skinning an Arm: Skel Animations

\skip SkelAnimation
\until joints

Instead of encoding joint animations directly on a Skeleton, the animations
are encoded in a `UsdSkelAnimation` primitive. The animation of a Skeleton is
kept separate in this manner both to allow different animation encodings
-- as different prim types -- as well as for the sake of \ref UsdSkel_Instancing
"instancing".

An animation must define _joints_, which determines the set of joints that
the animation affects. This order does not need to match the order given on
the _Skeleton_ primitive. To emphasize that point, this particular animation
has been setup to affect only a single joint (`Shoulder/Elbow`).

\subsubsection UsdSkel_SchemaOverview_JointTransforms Joint Transforms

\dontinclude ./skinnedArm.usda
\skipline SkelAnimation
\skip translations
\until }
\until }

Currently, UsdSkel encodes joint animations as arrays of translation, rotation
and scale components. The encoding is vectorized for scalability reasons, and
with consideration for IO performance on large-scale crowds. It is broken into
these separate components primarily for the sake of interpolation, but this also
has storage benefits -- such as enabling separate run-length encoding for
different components. For example, if only the rotations are changing over time,
as is often the case, then we need only store animated values for those
rotations, and need not store unique scale/translation samples per frame.

These transform components combine to describe the *local space* transforms
of a set of joints. Helper methods UsdSkelDecomposeTransforms() and
UsdSkelMakeTransforms() can be used to convert between these components
and arrays of matrices.

Note that this encoding implies that joint local transforms must have an
_orthogonal_ basis.  While non-uniform scales may still be authored,
non-uniform scale values should only be used to apply reflections; each
component of the scale should otherwise have the same magnitude.
It is further _recommended_ that users make an effort to stick to purely
orthonormal transforms: Many applications do not support non-uniform joint
scaling, so translating non-orthonormal transforms to other packages may be
problematic.

\subsubsection UsdSkel_SchemaOverview_BindingAnAnimation Binding An Animation To A Skeleton

\dontinclude ./skinnedArm.usda
\skipline Skeleton
\skipline SkelAnimation
\skip scales
\skipline  }
\until animationSource
\until }

In order for a SkelAnimation to have any effect, it must be bound to a Skeleton.
This is done using the _skel:animationSource_ relationship, as created through
the UsdSkelBindingAPI.

The animation source binding is _inherited_ down namespace. For example,
suppose we have:

\code
def Scope "Scope" {
    
    rel skel:animationSource = </Anim>
    
    def Skeleton "Skel" {}
}
\endcode

In that case, the Skeleton at `</Scope/Skel>` inherits the animation source
binding established at `</Scope>`.
The primary motivation for this inheritance property is that it is the
means by which UsdSkel allows _instanced_ primitives to be driven by
different joint animations. The \ref UsdSkel_Instancing "instancing" section
goes into this in more detail.

\sa \ref UsdSkel_BindingAPI

\subsection UsdSkel_SchemaOverview_BindingSkeletons Skinning an Arm: Binding Skeletons to Prims

\dontinclude ./skinnedArm.usda
\skip Mesh
\until {
\skipline skel:skeleton
\skipline }

Skeletons are bound to the primitives that they skin by way of the
_skel:skeleton_ binding relationship, which can be set through the
UsdSkelBindingAPI, which must be __applied__ to the Mesh prim for the 
binding to be recognized.

This relationship works in a similar manner to the _skel:animationSource_
binding, in that the binding is inherited. Using this inheritance, it is common
on production assets to bind the skeleton at a higher scope, rather than on
individual primitives -- of which there may be many! For example:

\code
def SkelRoot "ComplexModelWithHundredsOfMeshes" {
    rel skel:skeleton = </SkelRoot/Skel>

    def Skeleton "Skel" {}

    def Mesh "Mesh0" {}
    def Mesh "Mesh1" {}
    ...
    def Mesh "Mesh1000" {}
}
\endcode

Note that it is only valid to bind skeletons either on UsdSkelRoot primitives,
or on their descendants.

This example shows the common case of mesh skinning, but UsdSkel's skinning is
not restricted to only meshes.

\subsection UsdSkel_SchemaOverview_JointInfluences Skinning an Arm: Joint Influences

\dontinclude ./skinnedArm.usda
\skip Mesh
\until {
\skip jointIndices
\until )
\until )
\skipline }


The _jointIndices_ and _jointWeights_ primvars store the joints and joint
weights for each vertex. Both primvars are required to have a matching
_interpolation_ and array size, and the _interpolation_ must be either
'constant' or 'vertex'.

Each value from _primvars:skel:jointIndices_ gives the index of a joint,
while the corresponding element from _primvars:skel:jointWeights_ provides
the weight for that joint.

Without setting any additional properties, the index values  stored by the
_jointIndices_ primvar refers to joints in the ordering defined by the
_joints_ attribute of the bound Skeleton. So, referring back to the definition
of the Skeleton:

\dontinclude ./skinnedArm.usda
\skip Skeleton
\until joints
\skip animationSource
\skipline }


Given the set of joints defined here, a value of **0** in _jointIndices_ refers
to the `Shoulder` joint, a value of **1** refers to `Shoulder/Elbow`, and so
forth.


\subsubsection UsdSkel_SchemaOverview_ExplicitJointOrders Explicit Joint Orders

Instead of using the joint order declared on the Skeleton, it is also possible
to define an explicit ordering directly on a skinned mesh. For example:

\code
def Mesh "Arm" {
    ...
    uniform token[] skel:joints = ["Shoulder/Elbow", "Shoulder"]
    int[] primvars:skel:jointIndices = [1,1,1,1, 1,1,1,1, 0,0,0,0] (
       interpolation = "vertex"
       elementSize = 1
    )
    float[] primvars:skel:jointWeights = [1,1,1,1, 1,1,1,1, 1,1,1,1] (
       interpolation = "vertex"
       elementSize = 1
    )
    ...
}
\endcode

Here, we have an explicit _skel:joints_ ordering. Using that ordering, a value
of **0** in _jointIndices_ refers to the `Shoulder/Elbow` joint, and a value
of **1** refers to the `Shoulder` joint.
As with the _skel:skeleton_ and _skel:animationSource_ binding relationships,
_primvars:skel:joints_ is an inherited property, and may be set set on
ancestor primitives. For that matter, *all* primvars in USD inherited down
namespace.


\subsection UsdSkel_SchemaOverview_GeomBindTransform Skinning an Arm: Geom Bind Transform


\dontinclude ./skinnedArm.usda
\skip Mesh
\until {
\skip geomBindTransform
\until }

The _primvars:skel:geomBindTransform_ primvar provides the world space
transform of a skinned primitive at bind-time. As with the case of the Skeleton's
bindTransform property, the bind transforms are given in world space, since
that is how most DCC apps tend to encode the property.

The points of the skinned primitive are transformed by the geomBindTransform prior to
skinning.

If left undefined, the geom bind transform is assumed to be the identity.

It is often the case that a skinned primitive will also have a transform authored
using the typical UsdGeomXformable API, in addition to the geomBindTransform.
If that is the case, the geomBindTransform is still the only transform used for
skinning.
