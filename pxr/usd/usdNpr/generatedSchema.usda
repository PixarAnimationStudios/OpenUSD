        by considering these surfaces to have only a single outward side,
        typically determined by control-point winding order and/or 
        orientation.  By doing so they can perform \"backface culling\" to
        avoid drawing the many polygons of most closed surfaces that face away
        from the viewer.
        
        However, it is often advantageous to model thin objects such as paper
        and cloth as single, open surfaces that must be viewable from both
        sides, always.  Setting a gprim's doubleSided attribute to 
        \\c true instructs all renderers to disable optimizations such as
        backface culling for the gprim, and attempt (not all renderers are able
        to do so, but the USD reference GL renderer always will) to provide
        forward-facing normals on each side of the surface for lighting
