/// \class UsdGeomXformable
///
/// Base class for all transformable prims, which allows arbitrary
/// sequences of component affine transformations to be encoded.
/// 
/// \note 
/// You may find it useful to review \ref UsdGeom_LinAlgBasics while reading
/// this class description.
/// 
/// <b>Supported Component Transformation Operations</b>
/// 
/// UsdGeomXformable currently supports arbitrary sequences of the following
/// operations, each of which can be encoded in an attribute of the proper
/// shape in any supported precision:
/// \li translate - 3D
/// \li scale     - 3D
/// \li rotateX   - 1D angle in degrees
/// \li rotateY   - 1D angle in degrees
/// \li rotateZ   - 1D angle in degrees
/// \li rotateABC - 3D where ABC can be any combination of the six principle
/// Euler Angle sets: XYZ, XZY, YXZ, YZX, ZXY, ZYX.  See
/// \ref usdGeom_rotationPackingOrder "note on rotation packing order"
/// \li orient    - 4D (quaternion)
/// \li transform - 4x4D 
/// 
/// <b>Creating a Component Transformation</b>
/// 
/// To add components to a UsdGeomXformable prim, simply call AddXformOp()
/// with the desired op type, as enumerated in \ref UsdGeomXformOp::Type,
/// and the desired precision, which is one of \ref UsdGeomXformOp::Precision.
/// Optionally, you can also provide an "op suffix" for the operator that 
/// disambiguates it from other components of the same type on the same prim.  
/// Application-specific transform schemas can use the suffixes to fill a role 
/// similar to that played by AbcGeom::XformOp's "Hint" enums for their own 
/// round-tripping logic.
/// 
/// We also provide specific "Add" API for each type, for clarity and 
/// conciseness, e.g. AddTranslateOp(), AddRotateXYZOp() etc.
/// 
/// AddXformOp() will return a UsdGeomXformOp object, which is a schema on a 
/// newly created UsdAttribute that provides convenience API for authoring
/// and computing the component transformations.  The UsdGeomXformOp can then
/// be used to author any number of timesamples and default for the op.
/// 
/// Each successive call to AddXformOp() adds an operator that will be applied
/// "more locally" than the preceding operator, just as if we were pushing
/// transforms onto a transformation stack - which is precisely what should
/// happen when the operators are consumed by a reader.
/// 
/// \note
/// If you can, please try to use the UsdGeomXformCommonAPI, which wraps
/// the UsdGeomXformable with an interface in which Op creation is taken
/// care of for you, and there is a much higher chance that the data you
/// author will be importable without flattening into other DCC's, as it
/// conforms to a fixed set of Scale-Rotate-Translate Ops.
/// 
/// \sa \ref usdGeom_xformableExamples "Using the Authoring API"
/// 
/// <b>Data Encoding and Op Ordering</b>
/// 
/// Because there is no "fixed schema" of operations, all of the attributes
/// that encode transform operations are dynamic, and are scoped in 
/// the namespace "xformOp". The second component of an attribute's name provides
/// the \em type of operation, as listed above.  An "xformOp" attribute can 
/// have additional namespace components derived from the \em opSuffix argument 
/// to the AddXformOp() suite of methods, which provides a preferred way of 
/// naming the ops such that we can have multiple "translate" ops with unique
/// attribute names. For example, in the attribute named 
/// "xformOp:translate:maya:pivot", "translate" is the type of operation and
/// "maya:pivot" is the suffix.
/// 
/// The following ordered list of attribute declarations in usda
/// define a basic Scale-Rotate-Translate with XYZ Euler angles, wherein the
/// translation is double-precision, and the remainder of the ops are single,
/// in which we will:
/// 
/// <ol>
/// <li> Scale by 2.0 in each dimension
/// <li> Rotate about the X, Y, and Z axes by 30, 60, and 90 degrees, respectively
/// <li> Translate by 100 units in the Y direction
/// </ol>
/// 
/// \code
/// float3 xformOp:rotateXYZ = (30, 60, 90)
/// float3 xformOp:scale = (2, 2, 2)
/// double3 xformOp:translate = (0, 100, 0)
/// uniform token[] xformOpOrder = [ "xformOp:translate", "xformOp:rotateXYZ", "xformOp:scale" ]
/// \endcode
/// 
/// The attributes appear in the dictionary order in which USD, by default,
/// sorts them.  To ensure the ops are recovered and evaluated in the correct
/// order, the schema introduces the **xformOpOrder** attribute, which
/// contains the names of the op attributes, in the precise sequence in which
/// they should be pushed onto a transform stack. **Note** that the order is
/// opposite to what you might expect, given the matrix algebra described in
/// \ref UsdGeom_LinAlgBasics.  This also dictates order of op creation,
/// since each call to AddXformOp() adds a new op to the end of the
/// \b xformOpOrder array, as a new "most-local" operation.  See 
/// \ref usdGeom_xformableExamples "Example 2 below" for C++ code that could
/// have produced this USD.
/// 
/// If it were important for the prim's rotations to be independently 
/// overridable, we could equivalently (at some performance cost) encode
/// the transformation also like so:
/// \code
/// float xformOp:rotateX = 30
/// float xformOp:rotateY = 60
/// float xformOp:rotateZ = 90
/// float3 xformOp:scale = (2, 2, 2)
/// double3 xformOp:translate = (0, 100, 0)
/// uniform token[] xformOpOrder = [ "xformOp:translate", "xformOp:rotateZ", "xformOp:rotateY", "xformOp:rotateX", "xformOp:scale" ]
/// \endcode
/// 
/// Again, note that although we are encoding an XYZ rotation, the three
/// rotations appear in the **xformOpOrder** in the opposite order, with Z,
/// followed, by Y, followed by X.
/// 
/// Were we to add a Maya-style scalePivot to the above example, it might 
/// look like the following:
/// \code
/// float3 xformOp:rotateXYZ = (30, 60, 90)
/// float3 xformOp:scale = (2, 2, 2)
/// double3 xformOp:translate = (0, 100, 0)
/// double3 xformOp:translate:scalePivot
/// uniform token[] xformOpOrder = [ "xformOp:translate", "xformOp:rotateXYZ", "xformOp:translate:scalePivot", "xformOp:scale" ]
/// \endcode
/// 
/// <b>Paired "Inverted" Ops</b>
/// 
/// We have been claiming that the ordered list of ops serves as a set
/// of instructions to a transform stack, but you may have noticed in the last
/// example that there is a missing operation - the pivot for the scale op
/// needs to be applied in its inverse-form as a final (most local) op!  In the 
/// AbcGeom::Xform schema, we would have encoded an actual "final" translation
/// op whose value was authored by the exporter as the negation of the pivot's
/// value.  However, doing so would be brittle in USD, given that each op can
/// be independently overridden, and the constraint that one attribute must be
/// maintained as the negation of the other in order for successful
/// re-importation of the schema cannot be expressed in USD.
/// 
/// Our solution leverages the **xformOpOrder** member of the schema, which,
/// in addition to ordering the ops, may also contain one of two special
/// tokens that address the paired op and "stack resetting" behavior.
/// 
/// The "paired op" behavior is encoded as an "!invert!" prefix in 
/// \b xformOpOrder, as the result of an AddXformOp(isInverseOp=True) call.  
/// The \b xformOpOrder for the last example would look like:
/// \code
/// uniform token[] xformOpOrder = [ "xformOp:translate", "xformOp:rotateXYZ", "xformOp:translate:scalePivot", "xformOp:scale", "!invert!xformOp:translate:scalePivot" ]
/// \endcode
/// 
/// When asked for its value via UsdGeomXformOp::GetOpTransform(), an
/// "inverted" Op (i.e. the "inverted" half of a set of paired Ops) will fetch 
/// the value of its paired attribute and return its negation.  This works for 
/// all op types - an error will be issued if a "transform" type op is singular 
/// and cannot be inverted. When getting the authored value of an inverted op 
/// via UsdGeomXformOp::Get(), the raw, uninverted value of the associated
/// attribute is returned.
/// 
/// For the sake of robustness, <b>setting a value on an inverted op is disallowed.</b>
/// Attempting to set a value on an inverted op will result in a coding error 
/// and no value being set. 
/// 
/// <b>Resetting the Transform Stack</b>
/// 
/// The other special op/token that can appear in \em xformOpOrder is
/// \em "!resetXformStack!", which, appearing as the first element of 
/// \em xformOpOrder, indicates this prim should not inherit the transformation
/// of its namespace parent.  See SetResetXformStack()
/// 
/// <b>Expected Behavior for "Missing" Ops</b>
/// 
/// If an importer expects Scale-Rotate-Translate operations, but a prim
/// has only translate and rotate ops authored, the importer should assume
/// an identity scale.  This allows us to optimize the data a bit, if only
/// a few components of a very rich schema (like Maya's) are authored in the
/// app.
