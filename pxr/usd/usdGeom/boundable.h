/// \class UsdGeomBoundable
///
/// Boundable introduces the ability for a prim to persistently
/// cache a rectilinear, local-space, extent.
/// 
/// \section UsdGeom_Boundable_Extent Why Extent and not Bounds ?
/// Boundable introduces the notion of "extent", which is a cached computation
/// of a prim's local-space 3D range for its resolved attributes <b>at the
/// layer and time in which extent is authored</b>.  We have found that with
/// composed scene description, attempting to cache pre-computed bounds at
/// interior prims in a scene graph is very fragile, given the ease with which
/// one can author a single attribute in a stronger layer that can invalidate
/// many authored caches - or with which a re-published, referenced asset can
/// do the same.
/// 
/// Therefore, we limit to precomputing (generally) leaf-prim extent, which
/// avoids the need to read in large point arrays to compute bounds, and
/// provides UsdGeomBBoxCache the means to efficiently compute and
/// (session-only) cache intermediate bounds.  You are free to compute and
/// author intermediate bounds into your scenes, of course, which may work
/// well if you have sufficient locks on your pipeline to guarantee that once
/// authored, the geometry and transforms upon which they are based will
/// remain unchanged, or if accuracy of the bounds is not an ironclad
/// requisite. 
/// 
/// When intermediate bounds are authored on Boundable parents, the child prims
/// will be pruned from BBox computation; the authored extent is expected to
/// incorporate all child bounds.
