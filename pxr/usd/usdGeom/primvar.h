/// \class UsdGeomPrimvar
///
/// Schema wrapper for UsdAttribute for authoring and introspecting attributes
/// that are primvars.
///
/// UsdGeomPrimvar provides API for authoring and retrieving the
/// additional data required to encode an attribute as a "Primvar",
/// which is a convenient contraction of RenderMan's "Primitive Variable" 
/// concept, which is represented in Alembic as 
/// "arbitrary geometry parameters" (arbGeomParams).
///
/// This includes the attribute's \ref GetInterpolation() "interpolation"
/// across the primitive (which RenderMan refers to as its 
/// \ref Usd_InterpolationVals "class specifier"
/// and Alembic as its <A HREF="https://github.com/alembic/alembic/blob/master/lib/Alembic/AbcGeom/GeometryScope.h#L47"> "geometry scope"</A>);
/// it also includes the attribute's \ref GetElementSize() "elementSize",
/// which states how many values in the value array must be aggregated for
/// each element on the primitive.  An attribute's \ref
/// UsdAttribute::GetTypeName() "TypeName" also factors into the encoding of 
/// Primvar.
///
/// \section Usd_What_Is_Primvar What is the Purpose of a Primvar?
///
/// There are three key aspects of Primvar identity:
/// \li Primvars define a value that can vary across the primitive on which
///     they are defined, via prescribed interpolation rules
/// \li Taken collectively on a prim, its Primvars describe the "per-primitive
///     overrides" to the material to which the prim is bound.  Different
///     renderers may communicate the variables to the shaders using different
///     mechanisms over which Usd has no control; Primvars simply provide the
///     classification that any renderer should use to locate potential
///     overrides.  Do please note that primvars override parameters on
///     UsdShadeShader objects, \em not 
///     \ref UsdShadeNodeGraph_Interfaces "Interface Attributes" on UsdShadeMaterial
///     prims.
/// \li *Primvars inherit down scene namespace.*  Regular USD attributes only
///     apply to the prim on which they are specified, but primvars implicitly
///     also apply to any child prims, unless those child prims have their
///     own opinions about those primvars.  This capability necessarily
///     entails added cost to check for inherited values, but the benefit
///     is that it allows concise encoding of certain opinions that broadly
///     affect large amounts of geometry.  See
///     UsdGeomImageable::FindInheritedPrimvars().
///
/// \section Usd_Creating_and_Accessing_Primvars Creating and Accessing Primvars
/// 
/// The UsdGeomPrimvarsAPI schema provides a complete interface for creating
/// and querying prims for primvars.
///
/// The <b>only</b> way to create a new Primvar in scene description is by
/// calling UsdGeomPrimvarsAPI::CreatePrimvar().  One cannot "enhance" or
/// "promote" an already existing attribute into a Primvar, because doing so
/// may require a namespace edit to rename the attribute, which cannot, in
/// general, be done within a single UsdEditContext.  Instead, create a new
/// UsdGeomPrimvar of the desired name using
/// UsdGeomPrimvarsAPI::CreatePrimvar(), and then copy the existing attribute
/// onto the new UsdGeomPrimvar.
///
/// Primvar names can contain arbitrary sub-namespaces. The behavior of
/// UsdGeomImageable::GetPrimvar(TfToken const &name) is to prepend "primvars:"
/// onto 'name' if it is not already a prefix, and return the result, which
/// means we do not have any ambiguity between the primvars
/// "primvars:nsA:foo" and "primvars:nsB:foo".  <b>There are reserved keywords
/// that may not be used as the base names of primvars,</b> and attempting to
/// create Primvars of these names will result in a coding error.  The
/// reserved keywords are tokens the Primvar uses internally to encode various
/// features, such as the "indices" keyword used by
/// \ref UsdGeomPrimvar_Indexed_primvars "Indexed Primvars".
///
/// \anchor UsdGeomPrimvar_Using_Primvar
/// If a client wishes to access an already-extant attribute as a Primvar,
/// (which may or may not actually be valid Primvar), they can use the
/// speculative constructor; typically, a primvar is only "interesting" if it
/// additionally provides a value.  This might look like:
/// \code
/// UsdGeomPrimvar primvar = UsdGeomPrimvar(usdAttr);
/// if (primvar.HasValue()) {
///     VtValue values;
///     primvar.Get(&values, timeCode);
///     TfToken interpolation = primvar.GetInterpolation();
///     int     elementSize = primvar.GetElementSize();
///     ...
/// }
/// \endcode
///
/// or, because Get() returns `true` if and only if it found a value:
/// \code
/// UsdGeomPrimvar primvar = UsdGeomPrimvar(usdAttr);
/// VtValue values;
/// if (primvar.Get(&values, timeCode)) {
///     TfToken interpolation = primvar.GetInterpolation();
///     int     elementSize = primvar.GetElementSize();
///     ...
/// }
/// \endcode
///
/// \subsection Usd_Handling_Indexed_Primvars Proper Client Handling of "Indexed" Primvars
///
/// As discussed in greater detail in 
/// \ref UsdGeomPrimvar_Indexed_primvars "Indexed Primvars", primvars can 
/// optionally contain a (possibly time-varying) indexing attribute that 
/// establishes a sharing topology for elements of the primvar.  Consumers
/// can always chose to ignore the possibility of indexed data by exclusively 
/// using the ComputeFlattened() API.  If a client wishes to preserve indexing
/// in their processing of a primvar, we suggest a pattern like the following,
/// which accounts for the fact that a stronger layer can 
/// \ref UsdAttribute::Block() "block" a primvar's indexing from a weaker
/// layer, via UsdGeomPrimvar::BlockIndices():
/// \code
/// VtValue values;
/// VtIntArray indices;
///
/// if (primvar.Get(&values, timeCode)){
///     if (primvar.GetIndices(&indices, timeCode)){
///         // primvar is indexed: validate/process values and indices together
///     }
///     else {
///         // primvar is not indexed: validate/process values as flat array
///     }
/// }
/// \endcode
///
/// \subsection Usd_Primvar_As_Attribute UsdGeomPrimvar and UsdAttribute API
/// 
/// UsdGeomPrimvar presents a small slice of the UsdAttribute API - enough to 
/// extract the data that comprises the "Declaration info", and get/set of
/// the attribute value.  A UsdGeomPrimvar also auto-converts to UsdAttribute, 
/// so you can pass a UsdGeomPrimvar to any function that accepts a UsdAttribute
/// or const-ref thereto.
///
/// \section Usd_Primvar_Types Primvar Allowed Scene Description Types and Plurality
/// There are no limitations imposed on the allowable scene description types
/// for Primvars; it is the responsibility of each consuming client to perform
/// renderer-specific conversions, if need be (the USD distribution will include
/// reference RenderMan conversion utilities).
///
/// A note about type plurality of Primvars: It is legitimate for a Primvar
/// to be of scalar or array type, and again, consuming clients must be
/// prepared to accommodate both.  However, while it is not possible, in all
/// cases, for USD to \em prevent one from \em changing the type of an attribute
/// in different layers or variants of an asset, it is never a good idea to
/// do so.  This is relevant because, except in a few special cases, it is
/// not possible to encode an \em interpolation of any value greater than 
/// \em constant without providing multiple (i.e. array) data values. Therefore,
/// if there is any possibility that downstream clients might need to change
/// a Primvar's interpolation, the Primvar-creator should encode it as an
/// array rather than a scalar.
///
/// Why allow scalar values at all, then?  First, sometimes it brings clarity
/// to (use of) a shader's API to acknowledge that some parameters are meant
/// to be single-valued over a shaded primitive.  Second, many DCC's provide
/// far richer affordances for editing scalars than they do array values, and
/// we feel it is safer to let the content creator make the decision/tradeoff
/// of which kind of flexibility is more relevant, rather than leaving it to
/// an importer/exporter pair to interpret.
///
/// Also, like all attributes, Primvars can be time-sampled, and values can
/// be authored and consumed just as any other attribute.  There is currently
/// no validation that the length of value arrays matches to the size 
/// required by a gprim's topology, interpolation, and elementSize.
///
/// For consumer convenience, we provide GetDeclarationInfo(), which returns
/// all the type information (other than topology) needed to compute the
/// required array size, which is also all the information required to 
/// prepare the Primvar's value for consumption by a renderer.
///
/// \section Usd_UsdGeomPrimvar_Lifetime Lifetime Management and Primvar Validity
///
/// UsdGeomPrimvar has an explicit bool operator that validates that
/// the attribute IsDefined() and thus valid for querying and authoring
/// values and metadata.  This is a fairly expensive query that we do 
/// <b>not</b> cache, so if client code retains UsdGeomPrimvar objects, it should 
/// manage its object validity closely, for performance.  An ideal pattern
/// is to listen for UsdNotice::StageContentsChanged notifications, and 
/// revalidate/refetch its retained UsdGeomPrimvar s only then, and otherwise use
/// them without validity checking.
///
/// \section Usd_InterpolationVals Interpolation of Geometric Primitive Variables
/// In the following explanation of the meaning of the various kinds/levels
/// of Primvar interpolation, each bolded bullet gives the name of the token
/// in \ref UsdGeomTokens that provides the value.  So to set a Primvar's
/// interpolation to "varying", one would:
/// \code
/// primvar.SetInterpolation(UsdGeomTokens->varying);
/// \endcode
/// 
/// Reprinted and adapted from <a HREF="http://renderman.pixar.com/resources/current/rps/appnote.22.html#classSpecifiers">
/// the RPS documentation</a>, which contains further details, \em interpolation
/// describes how the Primvar will be interpolated over the uv parameter
/// space of a surface primitive (or curve or pointcloud).  The possible
/// values are:
/// \li <b>constant</b> One value remains constant over the entire surface 
///     primitive.
/// \li <b>uniform</b> One value remains constant for each uv patch segment of 
///     the surface primitive (which is a \em face for meshes). 
/// \li <b>varying</b> Four values are interpolated over each uv patch segment 
///     of the surface. Bilinear interpolation is used for interpolation 
///     between the four values.
/// \li <b>vertex</b> Values are interpolated between each vertex in the 
///     surface primitive. The basis function of the surface is used for 
///     interpolation between vertices.
/// \li <b>faceVarying</b> For polygons and subdivision surfaces, four values 
///     are interpolated over each face of the mesh. Bilinear interpolation 
///     is used for interpolation between the four values.
///
/// \section Usd_Extending_UsdObject_Classes UsdGeomPrimvar As Example of Attribute Schema
///
/// Just as UsdSchemaBase and its subclasses provide the pattern for how to
/// layer schema onto the generic UsdPrim object, UsdGeomPrimvar provides an
/// example of how to layer schema onto a generic UsdAttribute object.  In both
/// cases, the schema object wraps and contains the UsdObject.
///
/// \section Usd_UsdGeomPrimvar_Inheritance Primvar Namespace Inheritance
///
/// Constant interpolation primvar values can be inherited down namespace.
/// That is, a primvar value set on a prim will also apply to any child
/// prims, unless those children have their own opinions about those named
/// primvars. For complete details on how primvars inherit, see
/// \ref usdGeom_PrimvarInheritance .
