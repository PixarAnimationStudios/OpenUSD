/// \class UsdGeomBBoxCache
///
/// Caches bounds by recursively computing and aggregating bounds of children in
/// world space and aggregating the result back into local space.
///
/// The cache is configured for a specific time and
/// \ref UsdGeomImageable::GetPurposeAttr() set of purposes. When querying a
/// bound, transforms and extents are read either from the time specified or
/// UsdTimeCode::Default(), following \ref Usd_ValueResolution standard
/// time-sample value resolution.  As noted in SetIncludedPurposes(), changing
/// the included purposes does not invalidate the cache, because we cache
/// purpose along with the geometric data.
///
/// Child prims that are invisible at the requested time are excluded when
/// computing a prim's bounds.  However, if a bound is requested directly for an
/// excluded prim, it will be computed. Additionally, only prims deriving from
/// UsdGeomImageable are included in child bounds computations.
///
/// Unlike standard UsdStage traversals, the traversal performed by the
/// UsdGeomBBoxCache includes prims that are unloaded (see UsdPrim::IsLoaded()).
/// This makes it possible to fetch bounds for a UsdStage that has been opened
/// without \em forcePopulate , provided the unloaded model prims have authored
/// extent hints (see UsdGeomModelAPI::GetExtentsHint()).
///
/// This class is optimized for computing tight <b>untransformed "object"
/// space</b> bounds for component-models.  In the absence of component models,
/// bounds are optimized for world-space, since there is no other easily
/// identifiable space for which to optimize, and we cannot optimize for every
/// prim's local space without performing quadratic work.
///
/// The TfDebug flag, USDGEOM_BBOX, is provided for debugging.
///
/// Warnings:
///  * This class should only be used with valid UsdPrim objects.
///
///  * This cache does not listen for change notifications; the user is
///    responsible for clearing the cache when changes occur.
///
///  * Thread safety: instances of this class may not be used concurrently.
///
///  * Plugins may be loaded in order to compute extents for prim types provided
///    by that plugin.  See UsdGeomBoundable::ComputeExtentFromPlugins
