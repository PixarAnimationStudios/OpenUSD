/// \section usdGeom_PrimvarFetchingAPI Which Method to Use to Retrieve Primvars
/// 
/// While creating primvars is unambiguous (CreatePrimvar()), there are quite
/// a few methods available for retrieving primvars, making it potentially
/// confusing knowing which one to use.  Here are some guidelines:
/// 
/// \li If you are populating a GUI with the primvars already available for 
/// authoring values on a prim, use GetPrimvars().
/// \li If you want all of the "useful" (e.g. to a renderer) primvars
/// available at a prim, including those inherited from ancestor prims, use
/// FindPrimvarsWithInheritance().  Note that doing so individually for many
/// prims will be inefficient.
/// \li To find a particular primvar defined directly on a prim, which may
/// or may not provide a value, use GetPrimvar().
/// \li To find a particular primvar defined on a prim or inherited from
/// ancestors, which may or may not provide a value, use 
/// FindPrimvarWithInheritance().
/// \li To *efficiently* query for primvars using the overloads of
/// FindPrimvarWithInheritance() and FindPrimvarsWithInheritance(), one
/// must first cache the results of FindIncrementallyInheritablePrimvars() for
/// each non-leaf prim on the stage.
