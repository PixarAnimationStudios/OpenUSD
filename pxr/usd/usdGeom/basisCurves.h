/// \class UsdGeomBasisCurves
///
/// BasisCurves are a batched curve representation analogous to the
/// classic RIB definition via Basis and Curves statements. BasisCurves are
/// often used to render dense aggregate geometry like hair or grass.
/// 
/// A 'matrix' and 'vstep' associated with the \em basis are used to
/// interpolate the vertices of a cubic BasisCurves. (The basis attribute
/// is unused for linear BasisCurves.)
/// 
/// A single prim may have many curves whose count is determined implicitly by
/// the length of the \em curveVertexCounts vector.  Each individual curve is
/// composed of one or more segments. Each segment is defined by four vertices
/// for cubic curves and two vertices for linear curves. See the next section
/// for more information on how to map curve vertex counts to segment counts.
/// 
/// \section UsdGeomBasisCurves_Segment Segment Indexing
/// Interpolating a curve requires knowing how to decompose it into its 
/// individual segments.
/// 
/// The segments of a cubic curve are determined by the vertex count,
/// the \em wrap (periodicity), and the vstep of the basis. For linear
/// curves, the basis token is ignored and only the vertex count and
/// wrap are needed.
/// 
/// cubic basis   | vstep
/// ------------- | ------
/// bezier        | 3
/// catmullRom    | 1
/// bspline       | 1
/// 
/// The first segment of a cubic (nonperiodic) curve is always defined by its
/// first four points. The vstep is the increment used to determine what
/// vertex indices define the next segment.  For a two segment (nonperiodic)
/// bspline basis curve (vstep = 1), the first segment will be defined by
/// interpolating vertices [0, 1, 2, 3] and the second segment will be defined
/// by [1, 2, 3, 4].  For a two segment bezier basis curve (vstep = 3), the
/// first segment will be defined by interpolating vertices [0, 1, 2, 3] and
/// the second segment will be defined by [3, 4, 5, 6].  If the vstep is not
/// one, then you must take special care to make sure that the number of cvs
/// properly divides by your vstep. (The indices described are relative to
/// the initial vertex index for a batched curve.)
/// 
/// For periodic curves, at least one of the curve's initial vertices are
/// repeated to close the curve. For cubic curves, the number of vertices
/// repeated is '4 - vstep'. For linear curves, only one vertex is repeated
/// to close the loop.
/// 
/// Pinned curves are a special case of nonperiodic curves that only affects
/// the behavior of cubic Bspline and Catmull-Rom curves. To evaluate or render
/// pinned curves, a client must effectively add 'phantom points' at the 
/// beginning and end of every curve in a batch.  These phantom points
/// are injected to ensure that the inteprolated curve begins at P[0] and
/// ends at P[n-1].
/// 
/// For a curve with initial point P[0] and last point P[n-1], the phantom
/// points are defined as.
/// P[-1]  = 2 * P[0] - P[1]
/// P[n] = 2 * P[n-1] - P[n-2]
/// 
/// Pinned cubic curves will (usually) have to be unpacked into the standard
/// nonperiodic representation before rendering. This unpacking can add some 
/// additional overhead. However, using pinned curves reduces the amount of
/// data recorded in a scene and (more importantly) better records the
/// authors' intent for interchange.
/// 
/// \note The additional phantom points mean that the minimum curve vertex
/// count for cubic bspline and catmullRom curves is 2.
/// 
/// Linear curve segments are defined by two vertices.
/// A two segment linear curve's first segment would be defined by
/// interpolating vertices [0, 1]. The second segment would be defined by 
/// vertices [1, 2]. (Again, for a batched curve, indices are relative to
/// the initial vertex index.)
/// 
/// When validating curve topology, each renderable entry in the
/// curveVertexCounts vector must pass this check.
///

/// 
/// Linear interpolation is always used on curves of type linear.
/// 't' with domain [0, 1], the curve is defined by the equation 
/// P0 * (1-t) + P1 * t. t at 0 describes the first point and t at 1 describes
/// the end point.
/// 
/// \section UsdGeomBasisCurves_PrimvarInterpolation Primvar Interpolation
/// 
/// For cubic curves, primvar data can be either interpolated cubically between 
/// vertices or linearly across segments.  The corresponding token
/// for cubic interpolation is 'vertex' and for linear interpolation is
/// 'varying'.  Per vertex data should be the same size as the number
/// of vertices in your curve.  Segment varying data is dependent on the 
/// wrap (periodicity) and number of segments in your curve.  For linear curves,
/// varying and vertex data would be interpolated the same way.  By convention 
/// varying is the preferred interpolation because of the association of 
/// varying with linear interpolation.
/// 
/// \image html USDCurvePrimvars.png 
/// 
/// To convert an entry in the curveVertexCounts vector into a segment count 
/// for an individual curve, apply these rules.  Sum up all the results in
/// order to compute how many total segments all curves have.
/// 
/// The following tables describe the expected segment count for the 'i'th
/// curve in a curve batch as well as the entire batch. Python syntax
/// like '[:]' (to describe all members of an array) and 'len(...)' 
/// (to describe the length of an array) are used.
/// 
/// type    | wrap                        | curve segment count                    | batch segment count

/// periodic            | segmentCounts[i]             | sum(segmentCounts[:])
/// 
/// Both curve types additionally define 'constant' interpolation for the
/// entire prim and 'uniform' interpolation as per curve data.
/// 
/// 
/// \note Take care when providing support for linearly interpolated data for
/// cubic curves. Its shape doesn't provide a one to one mapping with either
/// the number of curves (like 'uniform') or the number of vertices (like
/// 'vertex') and so it is often overlooked. This is the only primitive in
/// UsdGeom (as of this writing) where this is true. For meshes, while they
/// use different interpolation methods, 'varying' and 'vertex' are both
/// specified per point. It's common to assume that curves follow a similar
/// pattern and build in structures and language for per primitive, per
/// element, and per point data only to come upon these arrays that don't 
/// quite fit into either of those categories. It is
/// also common to conflate 'varying' with being per segment data and use the
/// segmentCount rules table instead of its neighboring varying data table
/// rules. We suspect that this is because for the common case of
/// nonperiodic cubic curves, both the provided segment count and varying data
/// size formula end with '+ 1'. While debugging, users may look at the double
/// '+ 1' as a mistake and try to remove it.  We take this time to enumerate
/// these issues because we've fallen into them before and hope that we save
/// others time in their own implementations.
/// 
/// As an example of deriving per curve segment and varying primvar data counts from
/// the wrap, type, basis, and curveVertexCount, the following table is provided.
/// 
/// wrap          | type    | basis   | curveVertexCount  | curveSegmentCount  | varyingDataCount

/// \section UsdGeomBasisCurves_TubesAndRibbons Tubes and Ribbons
/// 
/// The strictest definition of a curve as an infinitely thin wire is not

/// 'width / 2'. Curves with both widths and normals are imaged as ribbons
/// oriented in the direction of the interpolated normal vectors.

/// also have interpolation metadata. It's common for authored widths to have
/// constant, varying, or vertex interpolation 
/// (see UsdGeomCurves::GetWidthsInterpolation()).  It's common for
/// authored normals to have varying interpolation 
/// (see UsdGeomPointBased::GetNormalsInterpolation()).
/// 
/// \image html USDCurveHydra.png
/// 
/// The file used to generate these curves can be found in
/// pxr/extras/examples/usdGeomExamples/basisCurves.usda.  It's provided
/// as a reference on how to properly image both tubes and ribbons. The first
/// row of curves are linear; the second are cubic bezier. (We aim in future
