    This test illustrates a difference in how Csd and Pcp compose
    nameChildren order.  Specifically, adding this reference arc
    from root.sdf should not affect the order the children of
    </Model/LeftRig>, but in Csd it does.  This seems like a bug in Csd,
    since referencing a model without making any overrides should leave
    it as-is.
