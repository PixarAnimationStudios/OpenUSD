    This museum exhibits some tricky interactions between relocations and 
    payloads.

    In the root layer, we have two model prims. The first is a payloaded
    model with a relocation that tries move a prim in the payload. After
    the payload is included, this relocation takes effect. The second
    is a reference to a payloaded model, with the same relocation authored
    in the referenced layer. In this case, the relocation does not take
    effect. This is expected behavior due to payloads being treated as
    though they were authored in the root layer stack; relocations in
    intermediate scenes get ignored.

    The payload itself has some relocations. In all cases, relocations
    internal to the payload should be respected.
