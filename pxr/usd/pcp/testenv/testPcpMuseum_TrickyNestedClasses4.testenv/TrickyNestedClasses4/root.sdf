    This museum exhibits behavior involving nested classes and ancestral
    arcs. In this case, the target prim /Rig/_Class_ToesRig/ThumbToeLOCALRig 
    inherits from source /Rig/_Class_ToesRig/_Class_Toe. Both target and
    source involve the same ancestral inherit arc between /Rig and 
    /_class_CharRig, but ultimately resolve to different paths across the
    inherit arc. In this case, Pcp must expand the ancestral inherit arc
    again to ensure all valid opinions are picked up.
    
    This example came from bug 69423, which involved M2's Pigeon character and
    rig.
