    """
    Regression test case for bug 69932. This bug manifested as cycle detection
    errors when composing affected prims, which was caused by Pcp erroneously
    trying to add an arc from a node to itself. This occurred when propagating
    implied inherits through a prim where relocations were involved.

    This test case was distilled from M2's Pigeon model, which is where the
    bug was originally found.
