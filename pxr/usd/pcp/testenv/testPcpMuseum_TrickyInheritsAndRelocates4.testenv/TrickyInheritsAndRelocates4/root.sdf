    Museum case demonstrating interaction between inherits
    and multiple levels of relocations. The most interesting prim to
    consider in this case is /FergusCloak/Anim/LArm/Curve/Const.
    That prim has relocations applied directly in the referenced
    CurveTrackRig.sdf and ancestrally in this layer. It also pulls in 
    opinions from a class via an inherit authored in that reference.
    Spooky inherits means we should also pull in opinions in the class
    authored locally, in the pre-relocated namespace.
