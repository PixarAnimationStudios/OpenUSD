    """
    This museum case demonstrates attribute connections to attributes in a class that's
    been relocated. HumanRig references in a sub-rig, FaceRig, in which a local class
    is inherited by two instances. The anim scopes of these instances are relocated
    out of the rig. 

    In HumanRig, an attribute connection is added to the anim scope in the class.
    We expect this connection to be translated so that it points to the attribute
    in the final relocated location of each instance's anim scope.

    This came from bug 33377.
