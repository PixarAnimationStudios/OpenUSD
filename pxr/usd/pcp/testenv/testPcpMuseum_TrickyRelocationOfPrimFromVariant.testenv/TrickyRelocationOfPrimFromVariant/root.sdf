    This museum exhibit demonstrates that relocations can be applied to
    prims that originate from references within variants. In this case,
    the root layer selects a particular variant on a referenced rig.
    That rig specifies a relocation on a prim that comes in via that
    variant. 

    The tricky part here is ensuring that the variant selection specified
    in the root layer is carried down when evaluating the subtree at the
    relocation source.

    This test case originated from bug 33553.
