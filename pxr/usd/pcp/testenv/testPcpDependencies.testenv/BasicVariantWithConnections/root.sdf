    This test exercises a reference to a main_cam model that
    contains a variant with attribute connection and relationship
    target paths.

    In particular, note that the target paths do NOT include
    variant selections.  This is because variant selections are
    an aspect of paths as used to store opinions in a layer,
    and are never used to identify objects in the scene.
