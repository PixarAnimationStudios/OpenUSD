    """
    This museum case is similar to TrickyInheritsInVariants. It demonstrates
    how the variant selection for a set remains consistent throughout a 
    prim index across multiple arcs. Inherit arcs in particular are tricky
    because they require a recursive prim index computation, which then
    needs a way to determine if there any relevant variant selections have
    already been made in the parent computation.

    This museum case has been distilled from bug 83587. With that bug,
    this museum case would wind up including opinions from both the
    full and tidscene modelComplexity variants; the correct behavior
    is to include only the full variant.
