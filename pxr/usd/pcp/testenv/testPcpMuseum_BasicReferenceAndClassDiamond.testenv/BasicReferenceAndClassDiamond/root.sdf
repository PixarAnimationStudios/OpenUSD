    In this example, Model is a root prim with a a reference arc.
    Below it, there is a local class and an instance of that class.
    The inheritance arc is set up across the reference (an "ancestral
    reference").  This raises an interesting problem when composing
    the Instance prim: does it "compose in" the LocalClass across
    the reference via two directions, one via the class in this
    file, and one via the inherits arc across the reference?

    We clearly only want to pick up the LocalClass opinion in
    model.sdf once.
