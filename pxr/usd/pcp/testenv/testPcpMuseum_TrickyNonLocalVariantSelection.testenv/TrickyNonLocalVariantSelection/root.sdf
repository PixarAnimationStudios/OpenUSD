    This test exercises selecting a variant that is defined non-locally
    (in this case, across a reference arc). Variants in a variant set are
    expected to compose together; in the composed scene for this layer, 
    the costume variant set should include {"basicCostume", "shotCostume", 
    "fancyCostume"}.

    We should be able to select a non-local variant without running into
    any errors.
