    """
    This museum case exercises the behavior when a target path authored
    within a variant points to a relocated prim. Since a variant can
    be thought of as a simple switch for local opinions, these target
    paths should behave just like target paths authored directly on
    the owning prim itself: they should use the post-relocation paths 
    instead of the pre-relocation paths.
