    """
    This museum case exhibits the interaction between relocated prims and
    inherited opinions. A relocated prim will still inherit the same 
    opinions it would have had it not been relocated. This is commonly 
    referred to as 'spooky inherits'.

    In this museum case, we have a symmetric rig defined in rig.sdf
    that is referenced by the model in model.sdf. Within the model, the
    LRig instance is relocated to the Anim scope. Finally, this model is
    referenced in by root.sdf.

    Due to spooky inherits, the final composed prim for /Model_1/Anim/LAnim
    should include opinions from the global class /_class_Model in root.sdf
    and model.sdf.
