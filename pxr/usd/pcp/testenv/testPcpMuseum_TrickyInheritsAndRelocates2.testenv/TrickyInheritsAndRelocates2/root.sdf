    This museum case demonstrates the expected behavior when
    a relocated prim inherits from multiple classes. In this
    example, the prim @b.sdf@</Group> inherits from global
    classes _class_A and _class_B. When that prim is referenced
    into and relocated in the root layer, it should inherit
    opinions from the corresponding classes in the root layer.

    This is a stripped-down case pulled from bug 81276.
