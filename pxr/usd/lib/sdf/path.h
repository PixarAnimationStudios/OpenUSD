/// \class SdfPath 
///
/// A path value used to locate objects in layers or scenegraphs.
///
/// \section sec_SdfPath_Overview Overview
///
/// SdfPath is used in several ways:
/// \li As a storage key for addressing and accessing values held in a SdfLayer
/// \li As a namespace identity for scenegraph objects
/// \li As a way to refer to other scenegraph objects through relative paths
///
/// The paths represented by an SdfPath class may be either relative or absolute.
/// Relative paths are relative to the prim object that contains them
/// (that is, if an SdfRelationshipSpec target is relative, it is relative to the
/// SdfPrimSpec object that owns the SdfRelationshipSpec object).
///
/// SdfPath objects can be readily created from and converted back to strings,
/// but as SdfPath objects, they have behaviors that make it easy and efficient
/// to work with them. The SdfPath class provides a full range of methods for
/// manipulating scene paths by appending a namespace child, appending a
/// relationship target, getting the parent path,
/// and so on.  Since the SdfPath class uses a node-based representation
/// internally, you should use the editing functions rather than converting to
/// and from strings if possible.
///
/// \section sec_SdfPath_Syntax Path Syntax
///
/// Like a filesystem path, an SdfPath is conceptually just a sequence of
/// path components.  Unlike a filesystem path, each component has a type,
/// and the type is indicated by the syntax.
///
/// Two separators are used between parts of a path. A slash ("/") following an
/// identifier is used to introduce a namespace child. A period (".") following
/// an identifier is used to introduce a property.  A property may also have
/// several non-sequential colons (':') in its name to provide a rudimentary
/// namespace within properties but may not end or begin with a colon.
///
/// A leading slash in the string representation of an SdfPath object indicates
/// an absolute path.  Two adjacent periods indicate the parent namespace.
///
/// Brackets ("[" and "]") are used to indicate relationship target paths for
/// relational attributes.
///
/// The first part in a path is assumed to be a namespace child unless
/// it is preceded by a period.  That means:
/// \li <c>/Foo</c> is an absolute path specifying the root prim Foo.
/// \li <c>/Foo/Bar</c> is an absolute path specifying namespace child Bar
///     of root prim Foo.
/// \li <c>/Foo/Bar.baz</c> is an absolute path specifying property \c baz of
///     namespace child Bar of root prim Foo.
/// \li <c>Foo</c> is a relative path specifying namespace child Foo of
///     the current prim.
/// \li <c>Foo/Bar</c> is a relative path specifying namespace child Bar of
///     namespace child Foo of the current prim.
/// \li <c>Foo/Bar.baz</c> is a relative path specifying property \c baz of
///     namespace child Bar of namespace child Foo of the current prim.
/// \li <c>.foo</c> is a relative path specifying the property \c foo of the
///     current prim.
/// \li <c>/Foo.bar[/Foo.baz].attrib</c> is a relational attribute path. The
///     relationship <c>/Foo.bar</c> has a target <c>/Foo.baz</c>. There is a
///     relational attribute \c attrib on that relationship-&gt;target pair.
///
/// \section sec_SdfPath_ThreadSafety A Note on Thread-Safety
///
/// SdfPath is strongly thread-safe, in the sense that zero additional
/// synchronization is required between threads creating or using SdfPath
/// values. Just like TfToken, SdfPath values are immutable. Internally,
/// SdfPath uses a global prefix tree to efficiently share representations
/// of paths, and provide fast equality/hashing operations, but
/// modifications to this table are internally synchronized. Consequently,
/// as with TfToken, for best performance it is important to minimize
/// the number of values created (since it requires synchronized access to
/// this table) or copied (since it requires atomic ref-counting operations).
