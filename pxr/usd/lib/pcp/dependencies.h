/// Clients can provide a collection of Sdf sites and get back a collection
/// of Pcp sites that use those Sdf sites.
///
/// Relocations can introduce dependencies on prims which are not namespace
/// ancestors.  These are known as "spooky" dependencies because of their
/// non-local effect.  For an example, see the TrickySpookyVariantSelection
/// museum case: the relocated anim scopes have a spooky dependency on the
/// rig scope from under which they were relocated.  We track spooky
/// dependencies separately because they do not contribute directly to
/// a computed prim index the way normal dependencies do, so they
/// require special handling.
