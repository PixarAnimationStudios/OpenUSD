    This example has a reference to a character group.
    The character group has several instances of a model,
    along with an override of that model's class (so as to
    affect all the instances).  One of the instances in 
    the group then overrides that class opinion.
    Back in the root layer, we override the class.

    This example illustrates a key difference in how global classes
    work in 30 vs. 2x.  Specifically, it shows how references
    strongly "encapsulate" the strength of their contents, including
    any internal opinions about classes.
