    This example has a prim, Root, with a reference to
    A.sdf. Root has an opinion about attr, which is
    private in A.sdf. This results in a property
    permission error. In addition, Root has opinions about
    a relationship and relational attribute that has been 
    marked private in A.sdf. This should also result in 
    permission errors, and the opinions should be ignored.

    There is another prim, Parent, with a child prim, Child.
    Parent has a reference to A.sdf, where Child is
    private. This results in a prim permission error.

    There is also a prim, Model, which inherits from
    _PrivateClass. Since _PrivateClass is private, this
    will result in an arc permission error.
