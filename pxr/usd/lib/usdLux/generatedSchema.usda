class "ListAPI" (
    doc = '''API schema to support discovery and publishing of lights in a scene.

    Discovering Lights via Traversal
    
    To motivate this API, consider what is required to discover all
    lights in a scene.  We must load all payloads and traverse all prims:

    \\code
    01  // Load everything on the stage so we can find all lights,
    02  // including those inside payloads
    03  stage->Load();
    04  
    05  // Traverse all prims, checking if they are of type UsdLuxLight
    06  // (Note: ignoring instancing and a few other things for simplicity)
    07  SdfPathVector lights;
    08  for (UsdPrim prim: stage->Traverse()) {
    09      if (prim.IsA<UsdLuxLight>()) {
    10          lights.push_back(i->GetPath());
    11      }
    12  }
    \\endcode

    This traversal -- suitably elaborated to handle certain details --
    is the first and simplest thing UsdLuxListAPI provides.
    UsdLuxListAPI::ComputeLightList() performs this traversal and returns
    all lights in the scene:

    \\code
    01  UsdLuxListAPI listAPI(stage->GetPseudoRoot());
    02  SdfPathVector lights = listAPI.ComputeLightList();
    \\endcode

    Publishing a Cached Light List

    Consider a USD client that needs to quickly discover lights but
    wants to defer loading payloads and traversing the entire scene
    where possible, and is willing to do up-front computation and
    caching to achieve that.

    UsdLuxListAPI provides a way to cache the computed light list,
    by publishing the list of lights onto prims in the model
    hierarchy.  Consider a big set that contains lights:

    \\code
    01  def Xform "BigSetWithLights" (
    02      kind = "assembly"
    03      payload = @BigSetWithLights.usd@   // Heavy payload
    04  ) {
    05      // Pre-computed, cached list of lights inside payload
    06      rel lightList = [
    07          <./Lights/light_1>,
    08          <./Lights/light_2>,
    09          ...
    10      ]
    11      token lightList:cacheBehavior = "consumeAndContinue";
    12  }
    \\endcode

    The lightList relationship encodes a set of lights, and the
    lightList:cacheBehavior property provides fine-grained
    control over how to use that cache.  (See details below.)

    The cache can be created by first invoking
    ComputeLightList(ComputeModeIgnoreCache) to pre-compute the list
    and then storing the result with UsdLuxListAPI::StoreLightList().

    To enable efficient retrieval of the cache, it should be stored
    on a model hierarchy prim.  Furthermore, note that while you can
    use a UsdLuxListAPI bound to the pseudo-root prim to query the
    lights (as in the example above) because it will perform a
    traversal over descendants, you cannot store the cache back to the
    pseduo-root prim.

    To consult the cached list, we invoke
    ComputeLightList(ComputeModeConsultModelHierarchyCache):

    \\code
    01  // Find and load all lights, using lightList cache where available
    02  UsdLuxListAPI list(stage->GetPseudoRoot());
    03  SdfPathSet lights = list.ComputeLightList(
    04      UsdLuxListAPI::ComputeModeConsultModelHierarchyCache);
    05  stage.LoadAndUnload(lights, SdfPathSet());
    \\endcode

    In this mode, ComputeLightList() will traverse the model
    hierarchy, accumulating cached light lists.

    Controlling Cache Behavior

    The lightList:cacheBehavior property gives additional fine-grained
    control over cache behavior:

    - The fallback value, "ignore", indicates that the lightList should
    be disregarded.  This provides a way to invalidate cache entries.
    Note that unless "ignore" is specified, a lightList with an empty
    list of targets is considered a cache indicating that no lights
    are present.

    - The value "consumeAndContinue" indicates that the cache should
    be consulted to contribute lights to the scene, and that recursion
    should continue down the model hierarchy in case additional lights
    are added as descedants. This is the default value established when
    StoreLightList() is invoked. This behavior allows the lights within
    a large model, such as the BigSetWithLights example above, to be
    published outside the payload, while also allowing referencing and
    layering to add additional lights over that set.

    - The value "consumeAndHalt" provides a way to terminate recursive
    traversal of the scene for light discovery. The cache will be
    consulted but no descendant prims will be examined.

    Instancing

    Where instances are present, UsdLuxListAPI::ComputeLightList() will
    return the instance-unique paths to any lights discovered within
    those instances.  Lights within a UsdGeomPointInstancer will
    not be returned, however, since they cannot be referred to
    solely via paths.

        - In a pipeline that does pruning (for complexity management)
        by deactivating prims composed from asset references, when we
        deactivate a purpose="render" prim, we will be able to discover
        and additionally deactivate its associated purpose="proxy" prim,
        so that preview renders reflect the pruning accurately.
        
        - DCC importers may be able to make more aggressive optimizations
        for interactive processing and display if they can discover the proxy
        for a given render prim.
        
        - With a little more work, a Hydra-based application will be able
        to map a picked proxy prim back to its render geometry for selection.

        classifying geometry into categories that can each be independently
        included or excluded from traversals of prims on a stage, such as
        rendering or bounding-box computation traversals.  The fallback
        purpose, default indicates that a prim has "no special purpose"
        and should generally be included in all traversals.  Subtrees rooted
        at a prim with purpose render should generally only be included
        when performing a "final quality" render.  Subtrees rooted at a prim
        with purpose proxy should generally only be included when 
        performing a lightweight proxy render (such as openGL).  Finally,
        subtrees rooted at a prim with purpose guide should generally
        only be included when an interactive application has been explicitly
        asked to "show guides". 
        
        In the previous paragraph, when we say "subtrees rooted at a prim",
        we mean the most ancestral or tallest subtree that has an authored,
        non-default opinion.  If the purpose of </RootPrim> is set to 
        "render", then the effective purpose of </RootPrim/ChildPrim> will
        be "render" even if that prim has a different authored value for
        purpose.  <b>See ComputePurpose() for details of how purpose 
        inherits down namespace</b>.
        
        As demonstrated in UsdGeomBBoxCache, a traverser should be ready to 
        accept combinations of included purposes as an input.
        
        Purpose render can be useful in creating "light blocker"
        geometry for raytracing interior scenes.  Purposes render and
        proxy can be used together to partition a complicated model
        into a lightweight proxy representation for interactive use, and a
        fully realized, potentially quite heavy, representation for rendering.
        One can use UsdVariantSets to create proxy representations, but doing
        so requires that we recompose parts of the UsdStage in order to change
        to a different runtime level of detail, and that does not interact
        well with the needs of multithreaded rendering. Purpose provides us with
        a better tool for dynamic, interactive complexity management.'''
