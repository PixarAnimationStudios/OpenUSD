/// \class UsdShadeMaterialBindingAPI
///
/// UsdShadeMaterialBindingAPI is an API schema that provides an 
/// interface for binding materials to prims or collections of prims 
/// (represented by UsdCollectionAPI objects). 
/// 
/// In the USD shading model, each renderable gprim computes a single 
/// <b>resolved Material</b> that will be used to shade the gprim (exceptions, 
/// of course, for gprims that possess UsdGeomSubsets, as each subset can be 
/// shaded by a different Material).  A gprim <b>and each of its ancestor 
/// prims</b> can possess, through the MaterialBindingAPI, both a 
/// <b>direct</b> binding to a Material, and any number of 
/// <b>collection-based</b> bindings to Materials; each binding can be generic 
/// or declared for a particular <b>purpose</b>, and given a specific <b>binding 
/// strength</b>. It is the process of "material resolution" (see 
/// \ref UsdShadeMaterialBindingAPI_MaterialResolution) that examines all of 
/// these bindings, and selects the one Material that best matches the 
/// client's needs.
/// 
/// The intent of <b>purpose</b> is that each gprim should be able to resolve a 
/// Material for any given purpose, which implies it can have differently bound 
/// materials for different purposes. There are two <i>special</i> values of 
/// <b>purpose</b> defined in UsdShade, although the API fully supports 
/// specifying arbitrary values for it, for the sake of extensibility:
/// <ul><li><b>UsdShadeTokens->full</b>: to be used when the purpose of the 
/// render is entirely to visualize the truest representation of a scene, 
/// considering all lighting and material information, at highest fidelity.</li>  
/// <li><b>UsdShadeTokens->preview</b>: to be used when the render is in 
/// service of a goal other than a high fidelity "full" render (such as scene
/// manipulation, modeling, or realtime playback). Latency and speed are 
/// generally of greater concern for preview renders, therefore preview 
/// materials are generally designed to be "lighterweight" compared to full
/// materials.</li></ul>
/// A binding can also have no specific purpose at all, in which 
/// case, it is considered to be the fallback or all-purpose binding (denoted 
/// by the empty-valued token <b>UsdShadeTokens->allPurpose</b>). 
/// 
/// The <b>purpose</b> of a material binding is encoded in the name of the 
/// binding relationship. 
/// <ul><li>
/// In the case of a direct binding, the <i>allPurpose</i> binding is 
/// represented by the relationship named <b>"material:binding"</b>. 
/// Special-purpose direct bindings are represented by relationships named
/// <b>"material:binding:<i>purpose</i></b>. A direct binding relationship 
/// must have a single target path that points to a <b>UsdShadeMaterial</b>.</li>
/// <li>
/// In the case of a collection-based binding, the <i>allPurpose</i> binding is 
/// represented by a relationship named 
/// "material:binding:collection:<i>bindingName</i>", where 
/// <b>bindingName</b> establishes an identity for the binding that is unique 
/// on the prim. Attempting to establish two collection bindings of the same 
/// name on the same prim will result in the first binding simply being 
/// overridden. A special-purpose collection-based binding is represented by a 
/// relationship named "material:binding:collection:<i>purpose:bindingName</i>".
/// A collection-based binding relationship must have exacly two targets, one of 
/// which should be a collection-path (see 
/// ef UsdCollectionAPI::GetCollectionPath()) and the other should point to a
/// <b>UsdShadeMaterial</b>. In the future, we may allow a single collection 
/// binding to target multiple collections, if we can establish a reasonable 
/// round-tripping pattern for applications that only allow a single collection 
/// to be associated with each Material.
/// </li>
/// </ul>
/// 
/// <b>Note:</b> Both <b>bindingName</b> and <b>purpose</b> must be 
/// non-namespaced tokens. This allows us to know the role of a binding 
/// relationship simply from the number of tokens in it. 
/// <ul><li><b>Two tokens</b>: the fallback, "all purpose", direct binding, 
/// <i>material:binding</i></li>
/// <li><b>Three tokens</b>: a purpose-restricted, direct, fallback binding, 
/// e.g. material:binding:preview</li>
/// <li><b>Four tokens</b>: an all-purpose, collection-based binding, e.g. 
/// material:binding:collection:metalBits</li>
/// <li><b>Five tokens</b>: a purpose-restricted, collection-based binding, 
/// e.g. material:binding:collection:full:metalBits</li>
/// </ul>
/// 
/// A <b>binding-strength</b> value is used to specify whether a binding 
/// authored on a prim should be weaker or stronger than bindings that appear 
/// lower in namespace. We encode the binding strength with as token-valued 
/// metadata <b>'bindMaterialAs'</b> for future flexibility, even though for 
/// now, there are only two possible values:
/// <i>UsdShadeTokens->weakerThanDescendants</i> and 
/// <i>UsdShadeTokens->strongerThanDescendants</i>. When binding-strength is 
/// not authored (i.e. empty) on a binding-relationship, the default behavior 
/// matches UsdShadeTokens->weakerThanDescendants.
/// 
/// \note If a material binding relationship is a built-in property defined as 
/// part of a typed prim's schema, a fallback value should not be provided for 
/// it. This is because the "material resolution" algorithm only conisders 
/// <i>authored</i> properties.

    /// <ul>

    /// Bindings lower in namespace (closer to leaf gprims) are stronger than 
    /// bindings on ancestors, unless they have their binding-strength set to 
    /// <i>UsdShadeTokens->strongerThanDescendants</i>.</li>
    /// <li>[2] A collection binding only applies to members of the collection 
    /// that are at or beneath the prim owning the binding relationship.</li>
    /// <li>[3] The purpose of the resolved material binding must either match 
    /// the requested special (i.e. restricted) purpose or be an all-purpose 
    /// binding. The restricted purpose binding, if available is preferred over 
    /// an all-purpose binding.
    /// <li>[4] At any given prim, the collection-based bindings are considered 
    /// to be stronger than the direct bindings. This reflects our belief that 
    /// the combination would appear primarily to define a "fallback" material 
    /// to be used by any child prims that are not targeted by a more specific 
    /// assignment</li>
    /// <li>[5] Collection-based binding relationships are applied in native 
    /// property order, with the earlier ordered binding relationships being 
    /// stronger.</li>
    /// <li>[6] The "namespace specificity" with which a prim is included in a
    /// collection is irrelevant to the binding strength of the collection. For 
    /// example, if a prim contains the ordered collection bindings 
    /// material:binding:collection:metalBits and 
    /// material:binding:collection:plasticBits, each of which targets a 
    /// collection of the same name, then if metalBits includes </Chair/Back>, 
    /// while plasticBits includes </Chair/Back/Brace/Rivet>, the binding for 
    /// </Chair/Back/Brace/Rivet> will be metalBits, because the metalBits 
    /// collection is bound more strongly than the plasticBits, and includes 
    /// an ancestor of </Chair/Back/Brace/Rivet>.
