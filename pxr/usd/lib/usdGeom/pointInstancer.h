/// \class UsdGeomPointInstancer
///
/// Encodes vectorized instancing of multiple, potentially
/// animated, prototypes (object/instance masters), which can be arbitrary
/// prims/subtrees on a UsdStage.
/// 
/// PointInstancer is a "multi instancer", as it allows multiple prototypes
/// to be scattered among its "points".  We use a UsdRelationship
/// \em prototypes to identify and order all of the possible prototypes, by
/// targeting the root prim of each prototype.  The ordering imparted by
/// relationships associates a zero-based integer with each prototype, and
/// it is these integers we use to identify the prototype of each instance,
/// compactly, and allowing prototypes to be swapped out without needing to
/// reauthor all of the per-instance data.
/// 
/// The PointInstancer schema is designed to scale to billions of instances,
/// which motivates the choice to split the per-instance transformation into
/// position, (quaternion) orientation, and scales, rather than a
/// 4x4 matrix per-instance.  In addition to requiring fewer bytes even if
/// all elements are authored (32 bytes vs 64 for a single-precision 4x4
/// matrix), we can also be selective about which attributes need to animate
/// over time, for substantial data reduction in many cases.
/// 
/// Note that PointInstancer is \em not a Gprim, since it is not a graphical
/// primitive by any stretch of the imagination. It \em is, however,
/// Boundable, since we will sometimes want to treat the entire PointInstancer
/// similarly to a procedural, from the perspective of inclusion or framing.
/// 
/// \section UsdGeomPointInstancer_varyingTopo Varying Instance Identity over Time
/// 
/// PointInstancers originating from simulations often have the characteristic
/// that points/instances are "born", move around for some time period, and then
/// die (or leave the area of interest). In such cases, billions of instances
/// may be birthed over time, while at any \em specific time, only a much
/// smaller number are actually alive.  To encode this situation efficiently,
/// the simulator may re-use indices in the instance arrays, when a particle
/// dies, its index will be taken over by a new particle that may be birthed in
/// a much different location.  This presents challenges both for 
/// identity-tracking, and for motion-blur.
/// 
/// We facilitate identity tracking by providing an optional, animatable
/// \em ids attribute, that specifies the 64 bit integer ID of the particle
/// at each index, at each point in time.  If the simulator keeps monotonically
/// increasing a particle-count each time a new particle is birthed, it will
/// serve perfectly as particle \em ids.
/// 
/// We facilitate motion blur for varying-topology particle streams by
/// optionally allowing per-instance \em velocities and \em angularVelocities
/// to be authored.  If instance transforms are requested at a time between
/// samples and either of the velocity attributes is authored, then we will
/// not attempt to interpolate samples of \em positions or \em orientations.
/// If not authored, and the bracketing samples have the same length, then we
/// will interpolate.
/// 
/// \section UsdGeomPointInstancer_transform Computing an Instance Transform
/// 
/// Each instance's transformation is a combination of the SRT affine transform
/// described by its scale, orientation, and position, applied \em after
/// (i.e. less locally) than the transformation computed at the root of the
/// prototype it is instancing.  In other words, to put an instance of a 
/// PointInstancer into the space of the PointInstancer's parent prim:
/// 
/// 1. Apply (most locally) the authored transformation for 
/// <em>prototypes[protoIndices[i]]</em>
/// 2. If *scales* is authored, next apply the scaling matrix from *scales[i]*
/// 3. If *orientations* is authored: **if *angularVelocities* is authored**, 
/// first multiply *orientations[i]* by the unit quaternion derived by scaling 
/// *angularVelocities[i]* by the time differential from the left-bracketing 
/// timeSample for *orientation* to the requested evaluation time *t*, 
/// storing the result in *R*, **else** assign *R* directly from 
/// *orientations[i]*.  Apply the rotation matrix derived from *R*.
/// 4. Apply the translation derived from *positions[i]*. If *velocities* is 
/// authored, apply the translation deriving from *velocities[i]* scaled by 
/// the time differential from the left-bracketing timeSample for *positions* 
/// to the requested evaluation time *t*.
/// 5. Least locally, apply the transformation authored on the PointInstancer 
/// prim itself (or the UsdGeomImageable::ComputeLocalToWorldTransform() of the 
/// PointInstancer to put the instance directly into world space)
/// 
/// 
/// We provide both high and low-level API's for dealing with the
/// transformation as a matrix, both will compute the instance matrices using
/// multiple threads; the low-level API allows the client to cache unvarying
/// inputs so that they need not be read duplicately when computing over
/// time.
/// 
/// 
/// \section UsdGeomPointInstancer_masking Masking Instances: "Deactivating" and Invising
/// 
/// Often a PointInstancer is created "upstream" in a graphics pipeline, and
/// the needs of "downstream" clients necessitate eliminating some of the 
/// instances from further consideration.  Accomplishing this pruning by 
/// re-authoring all of the per-instance attributes is not very attractive,
/// since it may mean destructively editing a large quantity of data.  We
/// therefore provide means of "masking" instances by ID, such that the 
/// instance data is unmolested, but per-instance transform and primvar data
/// can be retrieved with the no-longer-desired instances eliminated from the
/// (smaller) arrays.  PointInstancer allows two independent means of masking
/// instances by ID, each with different features that meet the needs of
/// various clients in a pipeline.  Both pruning features' lists of ID's are
/// combined to produce the mask returned by ComputeMaskAtTime().
/// 
/// \note If a PointInstancer has no authored \em ids attribute, the masking
/// features will still be available, with the integers specifying element
/// position in the \em protoIndices array rather than ID.
/// 
/// \subsection UsdGeomPointInstancer_inactiveIds InactiveIds: List-edited, Unvarying Masking
/// 
/// The first masking feature encodes a list of IDs in a list-editable metadatum
/// called \em inactiveIds, which, although it does not have any similar 
/// impact to stage poopulation as \ref UsdPrim::SetActive() "prim activation",
/// it shares with that feature that its application is uniform over all time.
/// Because it is list-editable, we can \em sparsely add and remove instances
/// from it in many layers.
/// 
/// This sparse application pattern makes \em inactiveIds a good choice when
/// further downstream clients may need to reverse masking decisions made
/// upstream, in a manner that is robust to many kinds of future changes to
/// the upstream data.
/// 
/// See ActivateId(), ActivateIds(), DeactivateId(), DeactivateIds(), 
/// ActivateAllIds()
/// 
/// \subsection UsdGeomPointInstancer_invisibleIds invisibleIds: Animatable Masking
/// 
/// The second masking feature encodes a list of IDs in a time-varying
/// Int64Array-valued UsdAttribute called \em invisibleIds , since it shares
/// with \ref UsdGeomImageable::GetVisibilityAttr() "Imageable visibility"
/// the ability to animate object visibility.
/// 
/// Unlike \em inactiveIds, overriding a set of opinions for \em invisibleIds
/// is not at all straightforward, because one will, in general need to
/// reauthor (in the overriding layer) **all** timeSamples for the attribute
/// just to change one Id's visibility state, so it cannot be authored
/// sparsely.  But it can be a very useful tool for situations like encoding
/// pre-computed camera-frustum culling of geometry when either or both of
/// the instances or the camera is animated.
/// 
/// See VisId(), VisIds(), InvisId(), InvisIds(), VisAllIds()
/// 
/// \section UsdGeomPointInstancer_protoProcessing Processing and Not Processing Prototypes
/// 
/// Any prim in the scenegraph can be targetted as a prototype by the
/// \em prototypes relationship.  We do not, however, provide a specific
/// mechanism for identifying prototypes as geometry that should not be drawn
/// (or processed) in their own, local spaces in the scenegraph.  We
/// encourage organizing all prototypes as children of the PointInstancer
/// prim that consumes them, and pruning "raw" processing and drawing
/// traversals when they encounter a PointInstancer prim; this is what the
/// UsdGeomBBoxCache and UsdImaging engines do.
/// 
/// There \em is a pattern one can deploy for organizing the prototypes
/// such that they will automatically be skipped by basic UsdPrim::GetChildren()
/// or UsdTreeIterator traversals.  Usd prims each have a 
/// \ref Usd_PrimSpecifiers "specifier" of "def", "over", or "class".  The
/// default traversals skip over prims that are "pure overs" or classes.  So
/// to protect prototypes from all generic traversals and processing, place
/// them under a prim that is just an "over".  For example,
/// \code
/// 01 def PxPointInstancer "Crowd_Mid"
/// 02 {
/// 03     rel prototypes = [ </Crowd_Mid/Prototypes/MaleThin_Business>, </Crowd_Mid/Prototypes/MaleTine_Casual> ]
/// 04     
/// 05     over "Prototypes" 
/// 06     {
/// 07          def "MaleThin_Business" (
/// 08              references = [@MaleGroupA/usd/MaleGroupA.usd@</MaleGroupA>]
/// 09              variants = {
/// 10                  string modelingVariant = "Thin"
/// 11                  string costumeVariant = "BusinessAttire"
/// 12              }
/// 13          )
/// 14          { ... }
/// 15          
/// 16          def "MaleThin_Casual"
/// 17          ...
/// 18     }
/// 19 }
/// \endcode
/// 
/// \section UsdGeomPointInstancer_primvars Primvars on PointInstancer
/// 
/// \ref UsdGeomPrimvar "Primvars" authored on a PointInstancer prim should
/// always be applied to each instance with \em constant interpolation at
/// the root of the instance.  When you are authoring primvars on a 
/// PointInstancer, think about it as if you were authoring them on a 
/// point-cloud (e.g. a UsdGeomPoints gprim).  The same 
/// <A HREF="http://renderman.pixar.com/resources/current/rps/appnote.22.html#classSpecifiers">interpolation rules for points</A> apply here, substituting
/// "instance" for "point".
/// 
/// In other words, the (constant) value extracted for each instance
/// from the authored primvar value depends on the authored \em interpolation
/// and \em elementSize of the primvar, as follows:
/// \li <b>constant</b> or <b>uniform</b> : the entire authored value of the
/// primvar should be applied exactly to each instance.
/// \li <b>varying</b>, <b>vertex</b>, or <b>faceVarying</b>: the first
/// \em elementSize elements of the authored primvar array should be assigned to
/// instance zero, the second \em elementSize elements should be assigned to
/// instance one, and so forth.
///
/// For any described attribute \em Fallback \em Value or \em Allowed \em Values below
/// that are text/tokens, the actual token is published and defined in \ref UsdGeomTokens.
/// So to set an attribute to the value "rightHanded", use UsdGeomTokens->rightHanded
