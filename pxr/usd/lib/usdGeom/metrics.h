/// \defgroup UsdGeomUpAxis_group Encoding Stage UpAxis
/// 
/// Even if all UsdGeomCamera objects in a scene are encoded with a 
/// transformation that assumes the Y axis is up, that cannot always imply
/// that the geometry contained in the scene was modeled with the Y axis
/// pointing up, since some modeling applications assume Z is up, and others
/// allow you to configure whether Y or Z is up.  Rather than impose one axis
/// or the other on all UsdGeom scenes - which would require either
/// transposing point coordinates into and out of some applications, or making
/// assumptions about where a -90 degree rotation has been applied and 
/// effectively, mysteriously swapping the roles of Y and Z coordinates -
/// we allow each stage to carry, in its root layer, a declaration of the
/// up axis for all the geometry contained in the stage, and require 
/// applications to consult it if they wish to create new cameras to view
/// the scene in its intended orientation.
///
/// Note that because you can make only a Stage-level declaration of up axis,
/// it must hold true for all referenced geometry and assets.  A conscientious
/// set/environment-construction tool could examine the up axis of referenced
/// assets as they are being referenced, and apply a corrective rotation
/// on the referencing prim as it is being added to the scene, when the
/// referenced up axis differs from the set's.
///
/// We provide free functions for setting (UsdGeomSetStageUpAxis()),
/// retrieving (UsdGeomGetStageUpAxis()), and declaring a site-level
/// fallback up axis (UsdGeomGetFallbackUpAxis()) that can be configured
/// with a PlugPlugin plugInfo.json file.  See the individual methods for
/// details.
///
/// The stage up axis is encoded as stage metadatum \em upAxis, whose legal
/// values are "Y" and "Z", as represented by UsdGeomTokens->y and
/// UsdGeomTokens->z.  Of course, constructing a correct camera view of a
/// scene depends not only on the up axis, but also on the handedness of the
/// coordinate system.  Like OpenGL and the fallback for
/// UsdGeomGprim::GetOrientationAttr(), <b>UsdGeom stipulates a right-handed
/// coordinate system.</b> Therefore, when viewing a UsdStage with a "Y" up
/// axis, the stage's Z axis will be pointing out of the screen, and when
/// viewing a UsdStage with a "Z" up axis, the stage's Y axis will be
/// pointing into the screen.
///
/// @{

/// Fetch and return \p stage 's upAxis.  If unauthored, will return the
/// value provided by UsdGeomGetFallbackUpAxis().  Exporters, however, are
/// strongly encouraged to always set the upAxis for every USD file they create.
///
/// \return one of: UsdGeomTokens->y or UsdGeomTokens->z, unless there was
/// an error, in which case returns an empty TfToken
