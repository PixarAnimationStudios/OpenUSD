    /// rendering or bounding-box computation traversals.  The fallback

    /// at a prim with purpose \em render should generally only be included
    /// when performing a "final quality" render.  Subtrees rooted at a prim
    /// with purpose \em proxy should generally only be included when 
    /// performing a lightweight proxy render (such as openGL).  Finally,
    /// subtrees rooted at a prim with purpose \em guide should generally
    /// only be included when an interactive application has been explicitly
    /// asked to "show guides". 
    /// 
    /// In the previous paragraph, when we say "subtrees rooted at a prim",
    /// we mean the most ancestral or tallest subtree that has an authored,
    /// non-default opinion.  If the purpose of </RootPrim> is set to 
    /// "render", then the effective purpose of </RootPrim/ChildPrim> will

    /// As demonstrated in UsdGeomBBoxCache, a traverser should be ready to

    /// Purpose \em render can be useful in creating "light blocker"
    /// geometry for raytracing interior scenes.  Purposes \em render and
    /// \em proxy can be used together to partition a complicated model
    /// into a lightweight proxy representation for interactive use, and a
