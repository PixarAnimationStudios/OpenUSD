/// \class UsdGeomBBoxCache
///
/// Caches bounds by recursively computing and aggregating bounds of children
/// in world space and aggregating the result back into local space.
///
/// The cache is configured for a specific time and  
/// \ref UsdGeomImageable::GetPurposeAttr() set of purposes. When
/// querying a bound, transforms and extents are read either from the time
/// specified or UsdTimeCode::Default(), following \ref Usd_ValueResolution standard
/// time-sample value resolution.  As noted in SetIncludedPurposes(), changing
/// the included purposes does not invalidate the cache, because we cache
/// purpose along with the geometric data.
///
/// Child prims that are invisible at the requested time are
/// excluded when computing a prim's bounds.  However, if a bound is requested
/// directly for an excluded prim, it will be computed. Additionally, only prims
/// deriving from UsdGeomImageable are included in child bounds computations. 
///
/// Unlike standard UsdStage traversals, the traversal performed by the
/// UsdGeomBBoxCache includes prims that are unloaded (see UsdPrim::IsLoaded()).
/// This makes it possible to fetch bounds for a UsdStage that has been
/// opened without \em forcePopulate , provided the unloaded model prims have
/// authored extent hints (see UsdGeomModelAPI::GetExtentsHint()).
///
/// This class is optimized for computing tight <b>untransformed "object" space</b> 
/// bounds for component-models.  In the absence of component models, bounds are 
/// optimized for world-space, since there is no other easily identifiable space 
/// for which to optimize, and we cannot optimize for every prim's local space 
/// without performing quadratic work.
/// 
/// The TfDebug flag, USDGEOM_BBOX, is provided for debugging.
///
/// Warnings:
///  * This class should only be used in conjunction with valid UsdPrim objects.
///
///  * This cache does not listen for change notifications; the user is
///    responsible for clearing the cache when changes occur.
///
///  * Thread safety: multiple instances of this class can be used from multiple
///    threads, but a single instance is not thread safe. It is thread safe to 
///    query bounds once they have been cached, as long as the time and included
///    purposes have not changed.  Therefore, if you wish to share cached bounds
///    among multiple worker threads, first query the bbox of the \b root of 
///    the stage in the master-thread prior to spawning the workers.  Querying
///    the root will cause all sub-results to be cached.
///
///  * Querying bounds will use multiple threads, upto the limit set in libWork.
