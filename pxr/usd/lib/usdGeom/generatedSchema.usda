    <b>A Note about UsdGeom Linear Algebra</b>
    
    To ensure reliable interchange, we stipulate the following foundational
    mathematical assumptions:
    - Matrices are laid out and indexed in row-major order, such that, given
    a \\c GfMatrix4d datum mat, mat[3][1] denotes the second column
    of the fourth row.
    - GfVec datatypes are row vectors that <b>pre-multiply</b> matrices to 
    effect transformations, which implies, for example, that it is the fourth 
    row of a GfMatrix4d that specifies the translation of the transformation.
    - GfQuatf and GfQuatd quaternion objects are laid out with the first 
    element as the imaginary 3-vector, followed by the real component.
    - All rotation angles are expressed in degrees, not radians.
    - Vector cross-products and rotations intrinsically follow the
    <A HREF=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right-hand_rule\">right hand rule.</A>


    <b>Supported Component Transformation Operations</b>
    
    UsdGeomXformable currently supports arbitrary sequences of the following
    operations, each of which can be encoded in an attribute of the proper
    shape in any supported precision:
    - translate - 3D
    - scale     - 3D
    - rotateX   - 1D angle in degrees
    - rotateY   - 1D angle in degrees
    - rotateZ   - 1D angle in degrees
    - rotateABC - 3D where ABC can be any combination of the six principle
                        Euler Angle sets: XYZ, XZY, YXZ, YZX, ZXY, ZYX.  See
                        \"note on rotation packing order\"
    - orient    - 4D (quaternion)
    - transform - 4x4D 
    
    <b>Creating a Component Transformation</b>
    
    To add components to a UsdGeomXformable prim, simply call AddXformOp()
    with the desired op type, as enumerated in \\ref UsdGeomXformOp::Type,
    and the desired precision, which is one of \\ref UsdGeomXformOp::Precision.
    Optionally, you can also provide an \"op suffix\" for the operator that 
    disambiguates it from other components of the same type on the same prim.  
    Application-specific transform schemas can use the suffixes to fill a role 
    similar to that played by AbcGeom::XformOp's \"Hint\" enums for their own 
    round-tripping logic.
    
    We also provide specific \"Add\" API for each type, for clarity and 
    conciseness, e.g. AddTranslateOp(), AddRotateXYZOp() etc.
    
    AddXformOp() will return a UsdGeomXformOp object, which is a schema on a 
    newly created UsdAttribute that provides convenience API for authoring
    and computing the component transformations.  The UsdGeomXformOp can then
    be used to author any number of timesamples and default for the op.
    
    Each successive call to AddXformOp() adds an operator that will be applied
    \"more locally\" than the preceding operator, just as if we were pushing
    transforms onto a transformation stack - which is precisely what should
    happen when the operators are consumed by a reader.
    
    \\note
    If you can, please try to use the UsdGeomXformCommonAPI, which wraps
    the UsdGeomXformable with an interface in which Op creation is taken
    care of for you, and there is a much higher chance that the data you
    author will be importable without flattening into other DCC's, as it
    conforms to a fixed set of Scale-Rotate-Translate Ops.
    
    \\sa \"Using the Authoring API\"
    
    <b>Data Encoding</b>
    
    Because there is no \"fixed schema\" of operations, all of the attributes
    that encode transform operations are custom, and are scoped in 
    the namespace \"xformOp\". The second component of an attribute's name provides
    the type of operation, as listed above.  An \"xformOp\" attribute can 
    have additional namespace components derived from the opSuffix argument 
    to the AddXformOp() suite of methods, which provides a preferred way of 
    naming the ops such that we can have multiple \"translate\" ops with unique
    attribute names. For example, in the attribute named 
    \"xformOp:translate:maya:pivot\", \"translate\" is the type of operation and
    \"maya:pivot\" is the suffix.
    
    For example, the following ordered list of attribute declarations in usda
    define a basic Scale-Rotate-Translate with XYZ Euler angles, wherein the
    translation is double-precision, and the remainder of the ops are single.
    \\code
    double3 xformOp:translate
    float3 xformOp:rotateXYZ
    float3 xformOp:scale
    \\endcode
    
    If it were important for the prim's rotations to be independently 
    overridable, we could equivalently (at some performance cost) encode
    the transformation also like so:
    \\code
    double3 xformOp:translate
    float xformOp:rotateZ
    float xformOp:rotateY
    float xformOp:rotateX
    float3 xformOp:scale
    \\endcode
    
    Were we to add a Maya-style scalePivot to the above example, it might 
    look like the following:
    \\code
    double3 xformOp:translate
    float xformOp:rotateXYZ
    double3 xformOp:translate:scalePivot
    float3 xformOp:scale
    \\endcode

    <b>Paired \"Inverted\" Ops and Op Ordering</b>

    We have been claiming that the ordered list of ops serves as a set
    of instructions to a transform stack, but you may have noticed in the last
    example that there is a missing operation - the pivot for the scale op
    needs to be applied in its inverse-form as a final op!  In the 
    AbcGeom::Xform schema, we would have encoded an actual \"final\" translation
    op whose value was authored by the exporter as the negation of the pivot's
    value.  However, doing so would be brittle in USD, given that each op can
    be independently overridden, and the constraint that one attribute must be
    maintained as the negation of the other in order for successful
    re-importation of the schema cannot be expressed in USD.
    
    Our solution leverages the last component of the encoding: we already
    require a statement of the op ordering (since they are attributes, they
    will, in general be retrieved in dictionary order using the core API's).
    We express this as a uniform builtin VtTokenArray attribute
    xformOpOrder, whose elements contain the full attribute names, 
    in order, of the UsdGeomXformable transform operations.  It also may
    contain one of two special tokens that address the paired op and
    \"stack resetting\" behavior.

    The \"paired op\" behavior is encoded as an \"!invert!\" prefix in 
    xformOpOrder, as the result of an AddXformOp(isInverseOp=True) call.  
    The xformOpOrder for the last example would look like:
    \\code
    uniform token[] xformOpOrder = [ \"xformOp:translate\", \"xformOp:rotateXYZ\", \"xformOp:translate:scalePivot\", \"xformOp:scale\", \"!invert!xformOp:translate:scalePivot\" ]
    \\endcode
    
    When asked for its value via UsdGeomXformOp::GetOpTransform(), an
    \"inverted\" Op (i.e. the \"inverted\" half of a set of paired Ops) will fetch 
    the value of its paired attribute and return its negation.  This works for 
    all op types - an error will be issued if a \"transform\" type op is singular 
    and cannot be inverted. When getting the authored value of an inverted op 
    via UsdGeomXformOp::Get(), the raw, uninverted value of the associated
    attribute is returned.

    For the sake of robustness, <b>setting a value on an inverted op is disallowed.</b>
    Attempting to set a value on an inverted op will result in a coding error 
    and no value being set. 
    
    <b>Resetting the Transform Stack</b>

    The other special op/token that can appear in xformOpOrder is
    \"!resetXformStack!\", which, appearing as the first element of 
    xformOpOrder, indicates this prim should not inherit the transformation
    of its namespace parent.  See SetResetXformStack()

    <b>Expected Behavior for \"Missing\" Ops</b>
    
    If an importer expects Scale-Rotate-Translate operations, but a prim
    has only translate and rotate ops authored, the importer should assume
    an identity scale.  This allows us to optimize the data a bit, if only
    a few components of a very rich schema (like Maya's) are authored in the
    app.

    Boundable introduces the notion of \"extent\", which is a cached computation
    of a prim's local-space 3D range for its resolved attributes <b>at the
    layer and time in which extent is authored</b>.  We have found that with
    composed scene description, attempting to cache pre-computed bounds at
    interior prims in a scene graph is very fragile, given the ease with which
    one can author a single attribute in a stronger layer that can invalidate
    many authored caches - or with which a re-published, referenced asset can
    do the same.
    
    Therefore, we limit to precomputing (generally) leaf-prim extent, which
    avoids the need to read in large point arrays to compute bounds, and
    provides UsdGeomBBoxCache the means to efficiently compute and
    (session-only) cache intermediate bounds.  You are free to compute and
    author intermediate bounds into your scenes, of course, which may work
    well if you have sufficient locks on your pipeline to guarantee that once
    authored, the geometry and transforms upon which they are based will
    remain unchanged, or if accuracy of the bounds is not an ironclad
    requisite. 
    
    When intermediate bounds are authored on Boundable parents, the child prims
    will be pruned from BBox computation; the authored extent is expected to

    The authored points, orders, knots, weights, and ranges are all that is
    required to render the nurbs patch.  However, the only way to model closed
    surfaces with nurbs is to ensure that the first and last control points
    along the given axis are coincident.  Similarly, to ensure the surface is
    not only closed but also C2 continuous, the last order - 1 control
    points must be (correspondingly) coincident with the first order - 1
    control points, and also the spacing of the last corresponding knots
    must be the same as the first corresponding knots.
    
    <b>Form</b> is provided as an aid to interchange between modeling and
    animation applications so that they can robustly identify the intent with
    which the surface was modelled, and take measures (if they are able) to
    preserve the continuity/concidence constraints as the surface may be rigged
    or deformed.  
    - An open-form NurbsPatch has no continuity constraints.
    - A closed-form NurbsPatch expects the first and last control points
    to overlap
    - A periodic-form NurbsPatch expects the first and last
    order - 1 control points to overlap.
    
    <b>Nurbs vs Subdivision Surfaces</b>
    
    Nurbs are an important modeling primitive in CAD/CAM tools and early
    computer graphics DCC's.  Because they have a natural UV parameterization
    they easily support \"trim curves\", which allow smooth shapes to be
    carved out of the surface.
    
    However, the topology of the patch is always rectangular, and joining two 
    nurbs patches together (especially when they have differing numbers of
    spans) is difficult to do smoothly.  Also, nurbs are not supported by
    the Ptex texturing technology (http://ptex.us).
    
    Neither of these limitations are shared by subdivision surfaces; therefore,
    although they do not subscribe to trim-curve-based shaping, subdivs are
    often considered a more flexible modeling primitive.

    often used to render dense aggregate geometry like hair.
    
    A curves prim may have many curves, determined implicitly by the length of
    the 'curveVertexCounts' vector.  An individual curve is composed of one 
    or more curve segments, the smoothly interpolated part between vertices.

    Curves may have a m'type' of either linear or cubic.  Linear curve 
    segments are interpolated between two vertices, and cubic curve segments are 
    interpolated between 4 vertices.  The segment count of a cubic curve  
    is determined by the vertex count, the 'wrap' (periodicity), and 
    the vstep of the basis.
    
    cubic basis   | vstep
    ------------- | -------------
    bezier        | 3
    catmullRom    | 1
    bspline       | 1
    hermite       | 2
    power         | 4
    
    The first segment of a cubic curve is always defined by its first 4 points. 
    The vstep is the increment used to determine what cv determines the 
    next segment.  For a two segment bspline basis curve (vstep = 1), the first 
    segment will be defined by interpolating vertices [0, 1, 2, 3] and the 
    second  segment will be defined by [1, 2, 3, 4].  For a two segment bezier 
    basis curve (vstep = 3), the first segment will be defined by interpolating 
    vertices [0, 1, 2, 3] and the second segment will be defined by 
    [3, 4, 5, 6].  If the vstep is not one, then you must take special care
    to make sure that the number of cvs properly divides by your vstep.  If 
    the type of a curve is linear, the basis matrix and vstep are unused.
    
    When validating curve topology, each entry in the curveVertexCounts vector
    must pass this check.

    -------------- | ---------------------------------------
    nonperiodic    | (curveVertexCounts[i] - 4) % vstep == 0
    periodic       | (curveVertexCounts[i]) % vstep == 0

        
    To convert an entry in the curveVertexCounts vector into a segment count 
    for an individual curve, apply these rules.  Sum up all the results in
    order to compute how many total segments all curves have.

    wrap          | segment count [linear curves]
    ------------- | ----------------------------------------
    nonperiodic   | curveVertexCounts[i] - 1
    periodic      | curveVertexCounts[i]

    periodic      | curveVertexCounts[i] / vstep 

        
    For cubic curves, primvar data can be either interpolated cubically between 
    vertices or linearly across segments.  The corresponding token
    for cubic interpolation is 'vertex' and for linear interpolation is
    'varying'.  Per vertex data should be the same size as the number
    of vertices in your curve.  Segment varying data is dependent on the 
    wrap (periodicity) and number of segments in your curve.
    
    wrap          | expected linear (varying) data size

    nonperiodic   | segmentCount + 1

    This prim represents two different entries in the RI spec:  RiBasis
    and RiCurves, hence the name \"BasisCurves.\"  If we are interested in
    specifying a custom basis as RenderMan allows you to do, the basis
