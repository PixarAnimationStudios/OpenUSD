    Which Method to Use to Retrieve Primvars
     
     While creating primvars is unambiguous (CreatePrimvar()), there are quite
     a few methods available for retrieving primvars, making it potentially
     confusing knowing which one to use.  Here are some guidelines:
     
     - If you are populating a GUI with the primvars already available for 
     authoring values on a prim, use GetPrimvars().
     - If you want all of the \"useful\" (e.g. to a renderer) primvars
     available at a prim, including those inherited from ancestor prims, use
     FindPrimvarsWithInheritance().  Note that doing so individually for many
     prims will be inefficient.
     - To find a particular primvar defined directly on a prim, which may
     or may not provide a value, use GetPrimvar().
     - To find a particular primvar defined on a prim or inherited from
     ancestors, which may or may not provide a value, use 
     FindPrimvarWithInheritance().
     - To *efficiently* query for primvars using the overloads of
     FindPrimvarWithInheritance() and FindPrimvarsWithInheritance(), one
     must first cache the results of FindIncrementallyInheritablePrimvars() for
     each non-leaf prim on the stage. """

    <b>Supported Component Transformation Operations</b>
    
    UsdGeomXformable currently supports arbitrary sequences of the following
    operations, each of which can be encoded in an attribute of the proper
    shape in any supported precision:
    - translate - 3D
    - scale     - 3D
    - rotateX   - 1D angle in degrees
    - rotateY   - 1D angle in degrees
    - rotateZ   - 1D angle in degrees
    - rotateABC - 3D where ABC can be any combination of the six principle
                        Euler Angle sets: XYZ, XZY, YXZ, YZX, ZXY, ZYX.  See
                        \"note on rotation packing order\"
    - orient    - 4D (quaternion)
    - transform - 4x4D 
    
    <b>Creating a Component Transformation</b>
    
    To add components to a UsdGeomXformable prim, simply call AddXformOp()
    with the desired op type, as enumerated in \\ref UsdGeomXformOp::Type,
    and the desired precision, which is one of \\ref UsdGeomXformOp::Precision.
    Optionally, you can also provide an \"op suffix\" for the operator that 
    disambiguates it from other components of the same type on the same prim.  
    Application-specific transform schemas can use the suffixes to fill a role 
    similar to that played by AbcGeom::XformOp's \"Hint\" enums for their own 
    round-tripping logic.
    
    We also provide specific \"Add\" API for each type, for clarity and 
    conciseness, e.g. AddTranslateOp(), AddRotateXYZOp() etc.
    
    AddXformOp() will return a UsdGeomXformOp object, which is a schema on a 
    newly created UsdAttribute that provides convenience API for authoring
    and computing the component transformations.  The UsdGeomXformOp can then
    be used to author any number of timesamples and default for the op.
    
    Each successive call to AddXformOp() adds an operator that will be applied
    \"more locally\" than the preceding operator, just as if we were pushing
    transforms onto a transformation stack - which is precisely what should
    happen when the operators are consumed by a reader.
    
    \\note
    If you can, please try to use the UsdGeomXformCommonAPI, which wraps
    the UsdGeomXformable with an interface in which Op creation is taken
    care of for you, and there is a much higher chance that the data you
    author will be importable without flattening into other DCC's, as it
    conforms to a fixed set of Scale-Rotate-Translate Ops.
    
    \\sa \"Using the Authoring API\"
    
    <b>Data Encoding and Op Ordering</b>
    
    Because there is no \"fixed schema\" of operations, all of the attributes
    that encode transform operations are dynamic, and are scoped in 
    the namespace \"xformOp\". The second component of an attribute's name provides
    the type of operation, as listed above.  An \"xformOp\" attribute can 
    have additional namespace components derived from the opSuffix argument 
    to the AddXformOp() suite of methods, which provides a preferred way of 
    naming the ops such that we can have multiple \"translate\" ops with unique
    attribute names. For example, in the attribute named 
    \"xformOp:translate:maya:pivot\", \"translate\" is the type of operation and
    \"maya:pivot\" is the suffix.
    
    The following ordered list of attribute declarations in usda
    define a basic Scale-Rotate-Translate with XYZ Euler angles, wherein the
    translation is double-precision, and the remainder of the ops are single,
    in which we will:

    <ol>
    <li> Scale by 2.0 in each dimension
    <li> Rotate about the X, Y, and Z axes by 30, 60, and 90 degrees, respectively
    <li> Translate by 100 units in the Y direction
    </ol>

    \\code
    float3 xformOp:rotateXYZ = (30, 60, 90)
    float3 xformOp:scale = (2, 2, 2)
    double3 xformOp:translate = (0, 100, 0)
    uniform token[] xformOpOrder = [ \"xformOp:translate\", \"xformOp:rotateXYZ\", \"xformOp:scale\" ]
    \\endcode

    The attributes appear in the dictionary order in which USD, by default,
    sorts them.  To ensure the ops are recovered and evaluated in the correct
    order, the schema introduces the **xformOpOrder** attribute, which
    contains the names of the op attributes, in the precise sequence in which
    they should be pushed onto a transform stack. **Note** that the order is
    opposite to what you might expect, given the matrix algebra described in
     This also dictates order of op creation,
    since each call to AddXformOp() adds a new op to the end of the
    \\b xformOpOrder array, as a new \"most-local\" operation.  See 
    \"Example 2 below\" for C++ code that could
    have produced this USD.
    
    If it were important for the prim's rotations to be independently 
    overridable, we could equivalently (at some performance cost) encode
    the transformation also like so:
    \\code
    float xformOp:rotateX = 30
    float xformOp:rotateY = 60
    float xformOp:rotateZ = 90
    float3 xformOp:scale = (2, 2, 2)
    double3 xformOp:translate = (0, 100, 0)
    uniform token[] xformOpOrder = [ \"xformOp:translate\", \"xformOp:rotateZ\", \"xformOp:rotateY\", \"xformOp:rotateX\", \"xformOp:scale\" ]
    \\endcode
    
    Again, note that although we are encoding an XYZ rotation, the three
    rotations appear in the **xformOpOrder** in the opposite order, with Z,
    followed, by Y, followed by X.

    Were we to add a Maya-style scalePivot to the above example, it might 
    look like the following:
    \\code
    float3 xformOp:rotateXYZ = (30, 60, 90)
    float3 xformOp:scale = (2, 2, 2)
    double3 xformOp:translate = (0, 100, 0)
    double3 xformOp:translate:scalePivot
    uniform token[] xformOpOrder = [ \"xformOp:translate\", \"xformOp:rotateXYZ\", \"xformOp:translate:scalePivot\", \"xformOp:scale\" ]
    \\endcode

    <b>Paired \"Inverted\" Ops</b>

    We have been claiming that the ordered list of ops serves as a set
    of instructions to a transform stack, but you may have noticed in the last
    example that there is a missing operation - the pivot for the scale op
    needs to be applied in its inverse-form as a final (most local) op!  In the 
    AbcGeom::Xform schema, we would have encoded an actual \"final\" translation
    op whose value was authored by the exporter as the negation of the pivot's
    value.  However, doing so would be brittle in USD, given that each op can
    be independently overridden, and the constraint that one attribute must be
    maintained as the negation of the other in order for successful
    re-importation of the schema cannot be expressed in USD.
    
    Our solution leverages the **xformOpOrder** member of the schema, which,
    in addition to ordering the ops, may also contain one of two special
    tokens that address the paired op and \"stack resetting\" behavior.

    The \"paired op\" behavior is encoded as an \"!invert!\" prefix in 
    \\b xformOpOrder, as the result of an AddXformOp(isInverseOp=True) call.  
    The \\b xformOpOrder for the last example would look like:
    \\code
    uniform token[] xformOpOrder = [ \"xformOp:translate\", \"xformOp:rotateXYZ\", \"xformOp:translate:scalePivot\", \"xformOp:scale\", \"!invert!xformOp:translate:scalePivot\" ]
    \\endcode
    
    When asked for its value via UsdGeomXformOp::GetOpTransform(), an
    \"inverted\" Op (i.e. the \"inverted\" half of a set of paired Ops) will fetch 
    the value of its paired attribute and return its negation.  This works for 
    all op types - an error will be issued if a \"transform\" type op is singular 
    and cannot be inverted. When getting the authored value of an inverted op 
    via UsdGeomXformOp::Get(), the raw, uninverted value of the associated
    attribute is returned.

    For the sake of robustness, <b>setting a value on an inverted op is disallowed.</b>
    Attempting to set a value on an inverted op will result in a coding error 
    and no value being set. 
    
    <b>Resetting the Transform Stack</b>

    The other special op/token that can appear in xformOpOrder is
    \"!resetXformStack!\", which, appearing as the first element of 
    xformOpOrder, indicates this prim should not inherit the transformation
    of its namespace parent.  See SetResetXformStack()

    <b>Expected Behavior for \"Missing\" Ops</b>
    
    If an importer expects Scale-Rotate-Translate operations, but a prim
    has only translate and rotate ops authored, the importer should assume
    an identity scale.  This allows us to optimize the data a bit, if only
    a few components of a very rich schema (like Maya's) are authored in the
    app.

    Boundable introduces the notion of \"extent\", which is a cached computation
    of a prim's local-space 3D range for its resolved attributes <b>at the
    layer and time in which extent is authored</b>.  We have found that with
    composed scene description, attempting to cache pre-computed bounds at
    interior prims in a scene graph is very fragile, given the ease with which
    one can author a single attribute in a stronger layer that can invalidate
    many authored caches - or with which a re-published, referenced asset can
    do the same.
    
    Therefore, we limit to precomputing (generally) leaf-prim extent, which
    avoids the need to read in large point arrays to compute bounds, and
    provides UsdGeomBBoxCache the means to efficiently compute and
    (session-only) cache intermediate bounds.  You are free to compute and
    author intermediate bounds into your scenes, of course, which may work
    well if you have sufficient locks on your pipeline to guarantee that once
    authored, the geometry and transforms upon which they are based will
    remain unchanged, or if accuracy of the bounds is not an ironclad
    requisite.

    not only closed but also C2 continuous, the last order - 1 control
    points must be (correspondingly) coincident with the first order - 1
    control points, and also the spacing of the last corresponding knots
    must be the same as the first corresponding knots.
    
    <b>Form</b> is provided as an aid to interchange between modeling and

    preserve the continuity/concidence constraints as the surface may be rigged
    or deformed.  
    - An open-form NurbsPatch has no continuity constraints.
    - A closed-form NurbsPatch expects the first and last control points
    to overlap
    - A periodic-form NurbsPatch expects the first and last
    order - 1 control points to overlap.
    
    <b>Nurbs vs Subdivision Surfaces</b>
    
    Nurbs are an important modeling primitive in CAD/CAM tools and early
    computer graphics DCC's.  Because they have a natural UV parameterization
    they easily support \"trim curves\", which allow smooth shapes to be
    carved out of the surface.
    
    However, the topology of the patch is always rectangular, and joining two 
    nurbs patches together (especially when they have differing numbers of
    spans) is difficult to do smoothly.  Also, nurbs are not supported by
    the Ptex texturing technology (http://ptex.us).
    
    Neither of these limitations are shared by subdivision surfaces; therefore,
    although they do not subscribe to trim-curve-based shaping, subdivs are
    often considered a more flexible modeling primitive.

    classic RIB definition via Basis and Curves statements. BasisCurves are
    often used to render dense aggregate geometry like hair or grass.

    A 'matrix' and 'vstep' associated with the basis are used to
    interpolate the vertices of a cubic BasisCurves. (The basis attribute
    is unused for linear BasisCurves.)
    
    A single prim may have many curves whose count is determined implicitly by
    the length of the curveVertexCounts vector.  Each individual curve is
    composed of one or more segments. Each segment is defined by four vertices
    for cubic curves and two vertices for linear curves. See the next section
    for more information on how to map curve vertex counts to segment counts.

    Segment Indexing
    Interpolating a curve requires knowing how to decompose it into its 
    individual segments.

    The segments of a cubic curve are determined by the vertex count,
    the wrap (periodicity), and the vstep of the basis. For linear
    curves, the basis token is ignored and only the vertex count and
    wrap are needed.
    
    cubic basis   | vstep
    ------------- | ------
    bezier        | 3
    catmullRom    | 1
    bspline       | 1
    hermite       | 2
    power         | 4
    
    The first segment of a cubic (nonperiodic) curve is always defined by its
    first four points. The vstep is the increment used to determine what
    vertex indices define the next segment.  For a two segment (nonperiodic)
    bspline basis curve (vstep = 1), the first segment will be defined by
    interpolating vertices [0, 1, 2, 3] and the second segment will be defined
    by [1, 2, 3, 4].  For a two segment bezier basis curve (vstep = 3), the
    first segment will be defined by interpolating vertices [0, 1, 2, 3] and
    the second segment will be defined by [3, 4, 5, 6].  If the vstep is not
    one, then you must take special care to make sure that the number of cvs
    properly divides by your vstep. (The indices described are relative to
    the initial vertex index for a batched curve.)

    For periodic curves, at least one of the curves' initial vertices are
    repeated to close the curve.
    (TODO: Explain the rules for how to repeat vertices for periodic curves.)

    Linear curve segments are defined by two vertices.
    A two segment linear curve's first segment would be defined by
    interpolating vertices [0, 1]. The second segment would be defined by 
    vertices [1, 2]. (Again, for a batched curve indices are relative to
    the initial vertex index.)

    When validating curve topology, each renderable entry in the
    curveVertexCounts vector must pass this check.

    type    | wrap           | validitity

    Cubic Vertex Interpolation
 
    \\image html USDCurveBasisMatrix.png width=750
        
    Linear Vertex Interpolation
 
    Linear interpolation is always used on curves of type linear.
    't' with domain [0, 1], the curve is defined by the equation 
    P0 * (1-t) + P1 * t. t at 0 describes the first point and t at 1 describes
    the end point.

    Primvar Interpolation
        
    For cubic curves, primvar data can be either interpolated cubically between 
    vertices or linearly across segments.  The corresponding token
    for cubic interpolation is 'vertex' and for linear interpolation is
    'varying'.  Per vertex data should be the same size as the number
    of vertices in your curve.  Segment varying data is dependent on the 
    wrap (periodicity) and number of segments in your curve.  For linear curves,
    varying and vertex data would be interpolated the same way.  By convention 
    varying is the preferred interpolation because of the association of 
    varying with linear interpolation.
    
    \\image html USDCurvePrimvars.png 

    To convert an entry in the curveVertexCounts vector into a segment count 
    for an individual curve, apply these rules.  Sum up all the results in
    order to compute how many total segments all curves have.

    The following tables describe the expected segment count for the 'i'th
    curve in a curve batch as well as the entire batch. Python syntax
    like '[:]' (to describe all members of an array) and 'len(...)' 
    (to describe the length of an array) are used.

    type    | wrap          | curve segment count                    | batch segment count                                                       
    ------- | ------------- | -------------------------------------- | --------------------------
    linear  | nonperiodic   | curveVertexCounts[i] - 1               | sum(curveVertexCounts[:]) - len(curveVertexCounts)
    linear  | periodic      | curveVertexCounts[i]                   | sum(curveVertexCounts[:])
    cubic   | nonperiodic   | (curveVertexCounts[i] - 4) / vstep + 1 | sum(curveVertexCounts[:] - 4) / vstep + len(curveVertexCounts)
    cubic   | periodic      | curveVertexCounts[i] / vstep           | sum(curveVertexCounts[:]) / vstep
 
    The following table descrives the expected size of varying
    (linearly interpolated) data, derived from the segment counts computed
    above.

    wrap          | curve varying count          | batch varying count
    ------------- | ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------
    nonperiodic   | segmentCounts[i] + 1         | sum(segmentCounts[:]) + len(curveVertexCounts)
    periodic      | segmentCounts[i]             | sum(segmentCounts[:])

    Both curve types additionally define 'constant' interpolation for the
    entire prim and 'uniform' interpolation as per curve data.

 
    \\note Take care when providing support for linearly interpolated data for
    cubic curves. Its shape doesn't provide a one to one mapping with either
    the number of curves (like 'uniform') or the number of vertices (like
    'vertex') and so it is often overlooked. This is the only primitive in
    UsdGeom (as of this writing) where this is true. For meshes, while they
    use different interpolation methods, 'varying' and 'vertex' are both
    specified per point. It's common to assume that curves follow a similar
    pattern and build in structures and language for per primitive, per
    element, and per point data only to come upon these arrays that don't 
    quite fit into either of those categories. It is
    also common to conflate 'varying' with being per segment data and use the
    segmentCount rules table instead of its neighboring varying data table
    rules. We suspect that this is because for the common case of
    nonperiodic cubic curves, both the provided segment count and varying data
    size formula end with '+ 1'. While debugging, users may look at the double
    '+ 1' as a mistake and try to remove it.  We take this time to enumerate
    these issues because we've fallen into them before and hope that we save
    others time in their own implementations.

    As an example of deriving per curve segment and varying primvar data counts from
    the wrap, type, basis, and curveVertexCount, the following table is provided.

    wrap          | type    | basis   | curveVertexCount  | curveSegmentCount  | varyingDataCount

    Tubes and Ribbons
    
    The strictest definition of a curve as an infinitely thin wire is not 
    particularly useful for describing production scenes. The additional
    widths and normals attributes can be used to describe cylindrical
    tubes and or flat oriented ribbons.

    Curves with only widths defined are imaged as tubes with radius
    'width / 2'. Curves with both widths and normals are imaged as ribbons
    oriented in the direction of the interpolated normal vectors.

    While not technically UsdGeomPrimvars, widths and normals
    also have interpolation metadata. It's common for authored widths to have
    constant, varying, or vertex interpolation 
    (see UsdGeomCurves::GetWidthsInterpolation()).  It's common for
    authored normals to have varying interpolation 
    (see UsdGeomPointBased::GetNormalsInterpolation()).

    \\image html USDCurveHydra.png

    The file used to generate these curves can be found in
    pxr/extras/examples/usdGeomExamples/basisCurves.usda.  It's provided
    as a reference on how to properly image both tubes and ribbons. The first
    row of curves are linear; the second are cubic bezier. (We aim in future
    releases of HdSt to fix the discontinuity seen with broken tangents to
    better match offline renderers like RenderMan.) The yellow and violet
    cubic curves represent cubic vertex width interpolation for which there is
    no equivalent for linear curves.

class PointInstancer "PointInstancer" (

    prims/subtrees on a UsdStage.
    
    PointInstancer is a \"multi instancer\", as it allows multiple prototypes
    to be scattered among its \"points\".  We use a UsdRelationship
    prototypes to identify and order all of the possible prototypes, by
    targeting the root prim of each prototype.  The ordering imparted by
    relationships associates a zero-based integer with each prototype, and
    it is these integers we use to identify the prototype of each instance,
    compactly, and allowing prototypes to be swapped out without needing to
    reauthor all of the per-instance data.
    
    The PointInstancer schema is designed to scale to billions of instances,
    which motivates the choice to split the per-instance transformation into
    position, (quaternion) orientation, and scales, rather than a
    4x4 matrix per-instance.  In addition to requiring fewer bytes even if
    all elements are authored (32 bytes vs 64 for a single-precision 4x4
    matrix), we can also be selective about which attributes need to animate
    over time, for substantial data reduction in many cases.
    
    Note that PointInstancer is not a Gprim, since it is not a graphical
    primitive by any stretch of the imagination. It is, however,
    Boundable, since we will sometimes want to treat the entire PointInstancer
    similarly to a procedural, from the perspective of inclusion or framing.

    Varying Instance Identity over Time
    
    PointInstancers originating from simulations often have the characteristic
    that points/instances are \"born\", move around for some time period, and then
    die (or leave the area of interest). In such cases, billions of instances
    may be birthed over time, while at any specific time, only a much
    smaller number are actually alive.  To encode this situation efficiently,
    the simulator may re-use indices in the instance arrays, when a particle
    dies, its index will be taken over by a new particle that may be birthed in
    a much different location.  This presents challenges both for 
    identity-tracking, and for motion-blur.
    
    We facilitate identity tracking by providing an optional, animatable
    ids attribute, that specifies the 64 bit integer ID of the particle
    at each index, at each point in time.  If the simulator keeps monotonically
    increasing a particle-count each time a new particle is birthed, it will
    serve perfectly as particle ids.
    
    We facilitate motion blur for varying-topology particle streams by
    optionally allowing per-instance velocities and angularVelocities
    to be authored.  If instance transforms are requested at a time between
    samples and either of the velocity attributes is authored, then we will
    not attempt to interpolate samples of positions or orientations.
    If not authored, and the bracketing samples have the same length, then we
    will interpolate.

    Computing an Instance Transform
    
    Each instance's transformation is a combination of the SRT affine transform
    described by its scale, orientation, and position, applied after
    (i.e. less locally) than the transformation computed at the root of the
    prototype it is instancing.  In other words, to put an instance of a 
    PointInstancer into the space of the PointInstancer's parent prim:
    
    1. Apply (most locally) the authored transformation for 
    <em>prototypes[protoIndices[i]]</em>
    2. If *scales* is authored, next apply the scaling matrix from *scales[i]*
    3. If *orientations* is authored: **if *angularVelocities* is authored**, 
    first multiply *orientations[i]* by the unit quaternion derived by scaling 
    *angularVelocities[i]* by the \"time differential\" 
    from the left-bracketing timeSample for *orientation* to the requested 
    evaluation time *t*, storing the result in *R*, **else** assign *R* 
    directly from *orientations[i]*.  Apply the rotation matrix derived 
    from *R*.
    4. Apply the translation derived from *positions[i]*. If *velocities* is 
    authored, apply the translation deriving from *velocities[i]* scaled by 
    the time differential from the left-bracketing timeSample for *positions* 
    to the requested evaluation time *t*.
    5. Least locally, apply the transformation authored on the PointInstancer 
    prim itself (or the UsdGeomImageable::ComputeLocalToWorldTransform() of the 
    PointInstancer to put the instance directly into world space)

    If neither *velocities* nor *angularVelocities* are authored, we fallback to
    standard position and orientation computation logic (using linear
    interpolation between timeSamples) as described by
    .

    \\anchor UsdGeom_PITimeScaling
    <b>Scaling Velocities for Interpolation</b>
    
    When computing time-differentials by which to apply velocity or
    angularVelocity to positions or orientations, we must scale by
    ( 1.0 / UsdStage::GetTimeCodesPerSecond() ), because velocities are recorded
    in units/second, while we are interpolating in UsdTimeCode ordinates.
    
    Additionally, if *motion:velocityScale* is authored or inherited (see
    UsdGeomMotionAPI::ComputeVelocityScale()), it is used to scale both the
    velocity and angular velocity by a constant value during computation. The
    *motion:velocityScale* attribute is encoded by UsdGeomMotionAPI.

    We provide both high and low-level API's for dealing with the
    transformation as a matrix, both will compute the instance matrices using
    multiple threads; the low-level API allows the client to cache unvarying
    inputs so that they need not be read duplicately when computing over
    time.

    See also .
    
    Primvars on PointInstancer
    
    \"Primvars\" authored on a PointInstancer prim should
    always be applied to each instance with constant interpolation at
    the root of the instance.  When you are authoring primvars on a 
    PointInstancer, think about it as if you were authoring them on a 
    point-cloud (e.g. a UsdGeomPoints gprim).  The same 
    <A HREF=\"http://renderman.pixar.com/resources/current/rps/appnote.22.html#classSpecifiers\">interpolation rules for points</A> apply here, substituting
    \"instance\" for \"point\".
    
    In other words, the (constant) value extracted for each instance
    from the authored primvar value depends on the authored interpolation
    and elementSize of the primvar, as follows:
    - <b>constant</b> or <b>uniform</b> : the entire authored value of the
    primvar should be applied exactly to each instance.
    - <b>varying</b>, <b>vertex</b>, or <b>faceVarying</b>: the first
    elementSize elements of the authored primvar array should be assigned to
    instance zero, the second elementSize elements should be assigned to
    instance one, and so forth.

    
    Masking Instances: \"Deactivating\" and Invising

    Often a PointInstancer is created \"upstream\" in a graphics pipeline, and
    the needs of \"downstream\" clients necessitate eliminating some of the 
    instances from further consideration.  Accomplishing this pruning by 
    re-authoring all of the per-instance attributes is not very attractive,
    since it may mean destructively editing a large quantity of data.  We
    therefore provide means of \"masking\" instances by ID, such that the 
    instance data is unmolested, but per-instance transform and primvar data
    can be retrieved with the no-longer-desired instances eliminated from the
    (smaller) arrays.  PointInstancer allows two independent means of masking
    instances by ID, each with different features that meet the needs of
    various clients in a pipeline.  Both pruning features' lists of ID's are
    combined to produce the mask returned by ComputeMaskAtTime().
    
    \\note If a PointInstancer has no authored ids attribute, the masking
    features will still be available, with the integers specifying element
    position in the protoIndices array rather than ID.

    \\subsection UsdGeomPointInstancer_inactiveIds InactiveIds: List-edited, Unvarying Masking

    The first masking feature encodes a list of IDs in a list-editable metadatum
    called inactiveIds, which, although it does not have any similar 
    impact to stage population as \"prim activation\",
    it shares with that feature that its application is uniform over all time.
    Because it is list-editable, we can sparsely add and remove instances
    from it in many layers.
    
    This sparse application pattern makes inactiveIds a good choice when
    further downstream clients may need to reverse masking decisions made
    upstream, in a manner that is robust to many kinds of future changes to
    the upstream data.
    
    See ActivateId(), ActivateIds(), DeactivateId(), DeactivateIds(), 
    ActivateAllIds()

    \\subsection UsdGeomPointInstancer_invisibleIds invisibleIds: Animatable Masking

    The second masking feature encodes a list of IDs in a time-varying
    Int64Array-valued UsdAttribute called invisibleIds , since it shares
    with \"Imageable visibility\"
    the ability to animate object visibility.
    
    Unlike inactiveIds, overriding a set of opinions for invisibleIds
    is not at all straightforward, because one will, in general need to
    reauthor (in the overriding layer) **all** timeSamples for the attribute
    just to change one Id's visibility state, so it cannot be authored
    sparsely.  But it can be a very useful tool for situations like encoding
    pre-computed camera-frustum culling of geometry when either or both of
    the instances or the camera is animated.
    
    See VisId(), VisIds(), InvisId(), InvisIds(), VisAllIds()
     
    Processing and Not Processing Prototypes
    
    Any prim in the scenegraph can be targetted as a prototype by the
    prototypes relationship.  We do not, however, provide a specific
    mechanism for identifying prototypes as geometry that should not be drawn
    (or processed) in their own, local spaces in the scenegraph.  We
    encourage organizing all prototypes as children of the PointInstancer
    prim that consumes them, and pruning \"raw\" processing and drawing
    traversals when they encounter a PointInstancer prim; this is what the
    UsdGeomBBoxCache and UsdImaging engines do.
    
    There is a pattern one can deploy for organizing the prototypes
    such that they will automatically be skipped by basic UsdPrim::GetChildren()
    or UsdPrimRange traversals.  Usd prims each have a 
    \"specifier\" of \"def\", \"over\", or \"class\".  The
    default traversals skip over prims that are \"pure overs\" or classes.  So
    to protect prototypes from all generic traversals and processing, place
    them under a prim that is just an \"over\".  For example,
    \\code
    01 def PointInstancer \"Crowd_Mid\"
    02 {
    03     rel prototypes = [ </Crowd_Mid/Prototypes/MaleThin_Business>, </Crowd_Mid/Prototypes/MaleTine_Casual> ]

    As described in GetExtentsHint() below, it is useful to cache extents
    at the model level.  UsdGeomModelAPI provides schema for computing and
    storing these cached extents, which can be consumed by UsdGeomBBoxCache to
    provide fast access to precomputed extents that will be used as the model's
    bounds ( see UsdGeomBBoxCache::UsdGeomBBoxCache() ).

    Draw Modes

    Draw modes provide optional alternate imaging behavior for USD subtrees with
    kind model. model:drawMode (which is inheritable) and
    model:applyDrawMode (which is not) are resolved into a decision to stop
    traversing the scene graph at a certain point, and replace a USD subtree
    with proxy geometry.

    The value of model:drawMode determines the type of proxy geometry:
    - origin - Draw the model-space basis vectors of the replaced prim.
    - bounds - Draw the model-space bounding box of the replaced prim.
    - cards - Draw textured quads as a placeholder for the replaced prim.
    - default - An explicit opinion to draw the USD subtree as normal.

    model:drawMode is inheritable so that a whole scene, a large group, or
    all prototypes of a model hierarchy PointInstancer can be assigned a draw
    mode with a single attribute edit.  model:applyDrawMode is meant to be
    written when an asset is authored, and provides flexibility for different
    asset types. For example, a character assembly (composed of character,
    clothes, etc) might have model:applyDrawMode set at the top of the
    subtree so the whole group can be drawn as a single card object. An effects
    subtree might have model:applyDrawMode set at a lower level so each
    particle group draws individually.

    Models of kind component are treated as if model:applyDrawMode
    were true.  This means a prim is drawn with proxy geometry when: the
    prim has kind component, and/or model:applyDrawMode is set; and
    the prim or an ancestor has a non-default value for model:drawMode.
    A value for model:drawMode on a child prim takes precedence over a
    value on a parent prim.

    Cards Geometry

    The specific geometry used in cards mode is controlled by the
    model:cardGeometry attribute:
    - cross - Generate a quad normal to each basis direction and negative.
                   Locate each quad so that it bisects the model extents.
    - box   - Generate a quad normal to each basis direction and negative.
                   Locate each quad on a face of the model extents, facing out.
    - fromTexture - Generate a quad for each supplied texture from
                         attributes stored in that texture's metadata.

    For cross and box mode, the extents are calculated for purposes
    default, proxy, and render, at their earliest authored time.
    If the model has no textures, all six card faces are rendered using
    model:drawModeColor. If one or more textures are present, only axes
    with one or more textures assigned are drawn.  For each axis, if both
    textures (positive and negative) are specified, they'll be used on the
    corresponding card faces; if only one texture is specified, it will be
    mapped to the opposite card face after being flipped on the texture's
    s-axis. Any card faces with invalid asset paths will be drawn with
    model:drawModeColor.

    Both model:cardGeometry and model:drawModeColor should be
    authored on the prim where the draw mode takes effect, since these
    attributes are not inherited.

    For fromTexture mode, only card faces with valid textures assigned
    are drawn. The geometry is generated by pulling the worldtoscreen
    attribute out of texture metadata.  This is expected to be a 4x4 matrix
    mapping the model-space position of the card quad to the clip-space quad
    with corners (-1,-1,0) and (1,1,0).  The card vertices are generated by
    transforming the clip-space corners by the inverse of worldtoscreen.
    Textures are mapped so that (s) and (t) map to (+x) and (+y) in clip space.
    If the metadata cannot be read in the right format, or the matrix can't
    be inverted, the card face is not drawn.

    All card faces are drawn and textured as single-sided.
