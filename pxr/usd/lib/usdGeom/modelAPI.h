    /// referenced scene description can also invalidate cached bounds in
    /// referencing layers.

    /// For these reasons, as a general rule, we only persistently cache
    /// leaf gprim extents in object space.  However, even with cached gprim
    /// extents, computing bounds can be expensive.  Since model-level bounds
    /// are so useful to many graphics applications, we make an exception,

    /// optional (whereas gprim extent is not); if authored, it should

    /// extentsHint array.  We do not skip over zero extents, so if a model
