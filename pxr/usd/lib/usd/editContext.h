///
/// A utility class to temporarily modify a stage's current EditTarget during
/// an execution scope.
///
/// This is an "RAII"-like object meant to be used as an automatic local
/// variable.  Upon construction, it sets a given stage's EditTarget, and upon
/// destruction it restores the stage's EditTarget to what it was previously.
///
/// Example usage, temporarily overriding a stage's EditTarget to direct an
/// edit to the stage's session layer.  When the \a ctx object expires, it
/// restores the stage's EditTarget to whatever it was previously.
///
/// \code
/// void SetVisState(const UsdPrim &prim, bool vis) {
///     UsdEditContext ctx(prim.GetStage(),
///                        prim.GetStage()->GetSessionLayer());
///     prim.GetAttribute("visible").Set(vis);
/// }
/// \endcode
///
/// <b>Threading Note</b>
///
/// When one thread is mutating a \a UsdStage, it is unsafe for any other thread
/// to either query or mutate it.  Using this class with a stage in such a way
/// that it modifies the stage's EditTarget constitutes a mutation.
