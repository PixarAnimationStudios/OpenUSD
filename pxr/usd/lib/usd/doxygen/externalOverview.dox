<b>USD is a system for authoring, composing, and reading hierarchically
organized scene description.</b> 

USD comprises a set of modules that scalably encode and interchange static 
and time-sampled 3D geometry and shading data between Digital Content Creation 
applications.  Domain-specific schema modules define the geometry and shading 
encoding atop USD's domain-agnostic core.

\page Usd_OverviewAndPurpose Overview and Purpose

In addition to addressing the interchange problem, USD also provides powerful
mechanisms for large-scale collaboration and context-dependent asset refinement
anywhere in a production pipeline.  For example:
 \li <b>layers</b> enable artists in different departments to all work 
simultaneously on the same "thing", whether that be a singular asset, an 
aggregate asset, a sequence, or a shot.
 \li <b>variants</b> enable asset creators to package up an enumerated set of
variations, which can be selected and re-selected by downstream artists in 
consuming contexts.  Using variants in combination with the <b>inherits</b> 
composition operator, a downstream artist can introduce \em new variations for 
all instances of an asset, in a particular (set, sequence, shot, etc.)
context.  Abilities like this can dramatically reduce the number of 
pipeline-stalling "asset fix requests" needed to support downstream artists.

 
This set of documents describes the concrete Usd software package, its APIs, 
and their effective use. In contrast, the forthcoming 
<em>Composition Compendium</em> centers on USD composition's detailed semantics.


Following is an overview of the architecture, followed by information for
\ref Usd_Quickstart "getting started with USD", and some 
\ref Usd_Background "background on how the USD project came to be."


\section Usd_ArchitecturalOverview Architectural Overview

The USD repository is divided into four "core" packages, plus 3rd-party
application plugins and extras:

\li <b>base</b> - Contains application-agnostic, foundation modules, upon
which most Pixar software builds, including possible future open-source 
projects.

\li <b>usd</b> - Contains all the modules directly related to authoring,
reading, and composing universal scene description.  Defines the plugin
interfaces by which USD can be extended and adapted.

\li <b>imaging</b> - Contains the embeddable Hydra hardware renderer as well
as other low-level, imaging-related services.

\li <b>usdImaging</b> - Ties usd and hydra together by providing an adapter
to Hydra that reads data directly and efficiently from a UsdStage.  Defines
a plugin interface by which the adapter can be extended, and provides
\em usdview , the standalone graphical USD inspector tool. 

\li <b>third_party</b> - Contains USD plugins for DCC applications.

\li <b>extras</b> - Contains a collection of tutorial material, sample code,
and small example USD assets.

To author and consume USD, you need only the \em base and \em usd packages.
Most of the open-source third-party plugins, however, do make use of 
\em usdImaging for fast preview, and as part of the answer to the question of
what application XXX should do when it is asked to import a USD prim type of
which it has no corresponding native representation.  (Answer: it creates
a proxy representation that delegates preview to usdImaging, and presents the
prim's properties for inspection and overriding.)

Following is a deeper indexing of the four packages.

\subsection Usd_Package_Base The "base" package

- \ref arch_page_front module centralizes functionality
  that must be implemented differently for different operating systems or
  architectures, so that we can avoid littering the entire code-base with
  conditionally-compiled code.

- \ref tf_page_front module is a catch-all for low-level,
  commonly used services developed at Pixar, including facilities for memory
  tracking, error reporting and debugging, string utilities, boost python
  wrapping aids, threading/synchronization tools, registry and singleton
  management, smart pointers, and "observer pattern" support, which we call
  "notification". 

- \ref gf_page_front module provides Pixar's equivalent to
  imath, and provides many of the types enumerated in Vt.  It also provides
  other foundational graphics abstractions like frusta and a camera
  model. Given unlimited resources we would have replaced our use of the
  linear algebra components in Gf with imath, but Gf's use in Pixar's
  code-base is substantial and its API's do not map one-to-one to imath.

- \ref js_page_front module provides a thin API wrapper on top of the 
  <a href="http://rapidjson.org/">RapidJSON</a> package, which is what our
  plugin system uses for multi-threaded plugin discovery. 

- \ref tracelite_page_front module provides a stubbed interface for embeddable
  performance-profiling tagging.  USD does not yet ship with an implementation
  of this interface, but may at some point in the future.

- \ref vt_page_front module provides many of the concrete types that Sdf
  is able to recognize and serialize.  It provides a copy-on-write
  array-type, VtArray, which is used for all array types in Usd, and an
  efficient type-erasure wrapper class, VtValue, that also provides datatype
  conversion facilities and support for unboxing python objects from boost
  python.  VtValue is supported in all Usd API for getting and setting
  values.

- \ref work_page_front module provides a thin abstraction layer on top of
  Intel's TBB (Thread Building Blocks), and is leveraged extensively in Usd
  core and higher-level services for multi-threading.

- \ref plug_page_front module provides the organization and access API for
  all plugins.  It identifies plugins by the existence of a plugInfo.json 
  manifest file, which enumerates the number and kinds of plugins provided 
  by a module.  


\subsection Usd_Package_Usd The "usd" package

The USD \em package begins with the low-level modules for path resolution,
scene description serialization, and composition, upon which the "core" Usd
module relies.  The USD package is rounded out by a set of schema and utility
modules that layer on top of the core.  In low-to-high order, the modules are:

- \ref ar_page_front module defines the abstract interface for USD's
  asset resolution plugin, so that clients can author asset references in
  their USD files that make sense to their asset management systems.  It also
  provides a "fallback resolver" that is active when no site-level plugin has
  been provided; the fallback resolver provides basic search-path based
  resolution.

- \ref kind_page_front module provides a simple, site-extensible token-based
  typing system, which USD uses, for example, to identify and classify types
  of "models".

- \ref sdf_page_front module defines the Usd data
  model, namely: prims, attributes, relationships, meta-data, as well as the
  concrete types that attributes can possess.  Sdf also provides the key
  abstraction SdfLayer, which represents a file of data subscribing to the
  Usd data model, and provides low-level data authoring and extraction API's.
  SdfLayer also has an associated plugin mechanism known as SdfFileFormat
  that allows any reasonable file format to be dynamically translated into
  Usd; it is via this mechanism that we added a binary encoding to the
  pre-existing ASCII format for Usd, as well as how we support referencing
  and reading of Alembic files.

- \ref pcp_page_front module implements the composition logic at the heart of
  USD; Pcp efficiently builds and caches an "index cache" that the Usd
  scenegraph uses to determine which prims need to be populated, and where to
  look for values for any particular property in a multi-layer aggregation of
  assets.

- \ref usd_page_front module builds the USD scene-graph (UsdStage), and provides
  the primary API's for authoring and reading composed scene description. The
  Usd module and the concepts it contains are meant to be fairly generic,
  allowing many different domain-specific schemas to be built over it, as the
  USD package does for geometry, shading, etc.  We make an exception for
  two particular concepts/schemas, "Model" and "AssetInfo", which are defined in
  the core Usd module, because they extremely valuable for organizing
  scene description, and other core behaviors are built on top of the concept
  of Model.

- \ref usdGeom_page_front : The primary graphics-supporting schema module
  for DCC interchange, UsdGeom provides geometric primitives (meshes, curves,
  patches, xforms, etc.), as well as a Camera schema and "Primvars" that
  encode UV's and various user-defined fields over a primitive.  The majority
  of the schema classes are produced entirely via the \em usdGenSchema code
  generator included with the core.

- \ref usdShade_page_front Schema module that defines Looks, Shaders,
  connectible Parameters, with API for building shading networks and
  user-facing "Look Interfaces" that allow shading networks to be shared (via
  instancing) by multiple Looks.  UsdShade also prescribes how geometry is
  \em bound to Looks.  With just the objects in UsdShade one can encode
  completely generic shading; however, it also allows renderer-specific
  shading schemas to be built on top of it, and a Look can host the network
  "terminals" for any number of renderer schemas.

- \ref usdHydra_page_front module provides a set of schemas for authoring
  Hydra-targetted shading in the USD shading model.

- \ref usdRi_page_front module for data targeted at Pixar's
  RenderMan specification.  Includes shading schemas for both RSL and RIS
  shading systems, as well as a "catch all" \c RiStatements schema for
  encoding various RenderMan concepts/directives, such as attributes,
  options, coordinate systems, etc.

- \ref usdUtils_page_front module provides a number of utilities and
  conventions that have proven useful in a USD-based pipeline.


\subsection Usd_Package_Imaging The "imaging" package

- \b Garch : The Graphics Architecture module provides abstractions for
  architecture-specific functionality that may pull in imaging-related
  dependencies.

- \b Glf : The Gl Foundations module provides access to textures, ptextures,
  and glslfx files.  It also provides some basic glsl shaders upon which Hd
  behaviors are built.

- \b CameraUtil The Camera Utilities module provides a small but important set of 
  common camera-related computations that don't really belong in the core
  GfCamera class.

- \b PxOsd : The Pixar OpenSubdiv module provides some higher-level utilities on
  top of OpenSubdiv that may, one day make it into OpenSubdiv, but are still 
  "cooking".  Hydra interacts with OpenSubdiv through pxOsd.

- \b Hd : The Hydra module provides the Hydra renderer.  Hydra uses
  OpenSubdiv for tessellating subdivision meshes, and supports general
  programmable glsl shaders, and multiple render passes.

- \b Hdx : The Hydra Extensions module provides higher-level functionality on
  top of Hydra, such as organization and packaging for particular kinds of
  multiple render-pass tasks.


\subsection Usd_Package_UsdImaging The "usdImaging" package

- \b UsdImaging : An adapter to Pixar's modern, high-performance GL
  rendering engine \em Hydra (which in turn leverages OpenSubdiv) that
  provides preview imaging (including streaming playback) for any UsdStage
  encoded with UsdGeom and UsdShade.  UsdImaging takes full advantage of
  scenegraph instancing in USD, and uses multiple threads to extract data
  from a UsdStage and marshal it into Hd objects.

- \b Usdviewq : A python package that provides the controller and GUI
  elements used by usdview.  The elements are structured for ease of
  embedding in other python applications, also.


\section Usd_PythonSupport Python Support, numpy, etc.

Usd includes python wrapping for all core classes and generated schema
classes.  Each module described in the last section, plus the core Usd
module, are independently importable.  Each module includes in-python
help/documentation extracted from the doxygen docs for the module.  We have
chosen, initially, to keep the python API as true to the C++ API as possible,
with one notable exceptions.

 - <b>Some underlying modules support more pythonic API's.</b> Some of the
   foundational modules shared with Presto, such as Sdf,  provide a more
   pythonic API in which member-variable-like-things become properties in
   python. We have hesitated to deploy this level of pythonification at higher
   levels of the system because SdfLayer is the only container that truly owns
   its data: all the primary Usd-level classes represent restricted views on
   data that resides in one-or-more SdfLayer s, and don't possess any member
   variables/properties other than those that serve as temporary caches.

USD's central array type, used to hold all array-valued scene description types,
is VtArray.  THe python wrapping for VtArray supports python's "buffer protocol",
so VtArray 's returned by USD to python can be trivially accessed like and
converted to native python containers, as well as numpy arrays.  Further, 
USD methods that expect a VtArray input argument should always successfully
convert native python containers and numpy arrays whose underlying element-type
is compatible.

\section Usd_Background USD: What's the Point, and Why Isn't it Alembic ?

The outward-facing goal of Universal Scene Description is to take the next
step in DCC application data interchange \em beyond what is encodable in the
ground-breaking Alembic interchange package.  The chief component of that
step is the ability to encode, interchange, and edit entire scenes with the
ability to share variation and repeated/instanced scene data across shots and
sequences, by providing robust asset-level (but not restricted to
asset-level) file-referencing with sparse override capabilities.
Additionally, USD provides a handful of other "composition operators" and
concepts that target:

 - Encoding asset variation and preserving the ability to switch variants
 late in the pipeline
 - Scale to scenes of unlimited complexity by deferring reading of heavy
 property data until it is needed (as in Alembic), and also by providing
 composition semantics that allow deferred (and reversible) loading and
 composition of arbitrary amounts of scene description without sacrificing
 the ability to perform robust dependency analysis between prims in a
 scene. (See the discussion of \ref Usd_Payloads "payloads" for more
 information). 

The USD project also developed under a high priority inward-facing mandate to
simplify and unify Pixar's binary cache-based geometry package (TidScene)
with its ASCII, animation and rigging scene description and composition
system (Presto core).  This mandate required that the advanced rigging
concepts and datatypes of Presto be layerable on top of a reduced-featureset,
shared (with USD) core.  Given the time and resource constraints, and
necessity to not massively disrupt our in-use codebase, we chose to largely
retain our existing data model, while looking to Alembic as a guide for many
schema decisions along the way.  While it is unlikely Pixar will attempt to
expand the Alembic API and core to encompass USD composition, asset resolution,
and necessary plugin mechanisms, we are committed to providing a USD 
"file format" plugin that allows the USD core and toolset to consume and author
Alembic files as if they were native USD files (obviously writing cannot always
produce an equally meaningful Alembic file because composition operators cannot
be represented in Alembic).
