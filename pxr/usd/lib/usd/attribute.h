/// A std::vector of UsdAttributes.
typedef std::vector<UsdAttribute> UsdAttributeVector;

/// \class UsdAttribute
///
/// Scenegraph object for authoring and retrieving numeric, string, and array
/// valued data, sampled over time.
///
/// The allowed value types for UsdAttribute are dictated by the Sdf
/// ("Scene Description Foundations") core's data model, which we summarize in
/// \ref Usd_Page_Datatypes .
///
/// \section Usd_AttributeQualities Attribute Defining Qualities
///
/// In addition to its value type, an Attribute has two other defining
/// qualities:
/// \li <b>Variability</b> Expresses whether an attribute is intended to
/// have time samples (GetVariability() == SdfVariabilityVarying), or only
/// a default (GetVariability() == SdfVariabilityUniform).  For more on
/// reasoning about time samples, 
/// see \ref Usd_AttributeValueMethods "Value & Time-Sample Accessors".
///
/// \li <b>Custom</b> Determines whether an attribute belongs to a
/// schema (IsCustom() == \c false), or is a user-defined, custom attribute.
/// schema attributes will always be defined on a prim of the schema type,
/// ans may possess fallback values from the schema, whereas custom 
/// attributes must always first be authored in order to be defined.  Note
/// that \em custom is actually an aspect of UsdProperty, as UsdRelationship
/// can also be custom or provided by a schema.
///
/// \section Usd_AttributeExistence Attribute Creation and Existence
///
/// One can always create an attribute generically via 
/// UsdPrim::CreateAttribute(), which ensures that an attribute "is defined"
/// in the current \ref UsdEditTarget .  In order to author any metadata or
/// a default or timesample for an attribute, <em>it must first be defined</em>.
/// It is sufficient that the attribute be defined in any one of the layers
/// participating in the stage's current composition; for \em builtin 
/// attributes (those belonging to the owning prim's defining schema, i.e.
/// the most specific subclass of UsdTypedSchema for which prim.IsA<schema>()
/// will evaluate to true) there need be no authored scene description, because
/// a definition is provided by the prim's schema definition.
///
/// <b>Creating</b> an attribute does not imply that the attribute has a value.
/// More broadly, in the following code:
/// \code
/// if (UsdAttribute attr = prim.GetAttribute(TfToken("myAttr"))){
///    ...
/// }
/// \endcode
///
/// The UsdAttribute passes the bool test, because it is defined; however, 
/// inside the clause, we have no guarantee that attr has a value.
///
/// \section Usd_AttributeInterpolation Attribute Value Interpolation
///
/// UsdAttribute supports two interpolation behaviors when retrieving
/// attribute values at times where no value is explicitly authored.
/// The desired behavior may be specified via UsdStage::SetInterpolationType.
/// That behavior will be used for all calls to UsdAttribute::Get.
///
/// The supported interpolation types are:
///
/// \li <b>Held</b> Attribute values are held constant between authored
/// values.  An attribute's value will be equal to the nearest preceding
/// authored value.  If there is no preceding authored value, the value 
/// will be equal to the nearest subsequent value.
///
/// \li <b>Linear</b> Attribute values are linearly interpolated between
/// authored values.
///
/// Linear interpolation is only supported for certain data types.  See 
/// USD_LINEAR_INTERPOLATION_TYPES for the list of these types.  Types 
/// that do not support linear interpolation will use held interpolation 
/// instead.
///
/// Linear interpolation is done element-by-element for shaped, vector, 
/// and matrix data types.  If linear interpolation is requested for
/// two shaped values with different shapes, held interpolation will
/// be used instead.
///
/// \section Usd_AssetPathValuedAttributes Attributes of type SdfAssetPath and UsdAttribute::Get()
///
/// If an attribute's value type is SdfAssetPath or SdfAssetPathArray, Get()
/// performs extra work to compute the resolved asset paths, using the layer
/// that has the strongest value opinion as the anchor for "relative" asset
/// paths.  Both the unresolved and resolved results are available through
/// SdfAssetPath::GetAssetPath() and SdfAssetPath::GetResolvedPath(),
/// respectively.
///
/// Clients that call Get() on many asset-path-valued attributes may wish to
/// employ an ArResolverScopedCache to improve asset path resolution
/// performance.
