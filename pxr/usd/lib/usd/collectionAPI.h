/// \class UsdCollectionAPI
///
/// This is a general purpose API schema, used to describe a 
/// collection of heterogeneous objects within the scene. "Objects" here may be 
/// prims or properties belonging to prims or other collections. It's an add-on 
/// schema that can be applied many times to a prim with different collection 
/// names. 
/// 
/// A collection allows an enumeration of a set of paths to include and a 
/// set of paths to exclude (beneath the included paths). Whether the 
/// descendants of an included path are members of a collection are decided 
/// by it's expansion rule (see below). A collection shall not exclude a 
/// path that's not already included by it. This rule isn't enforced by the 
/// authoring API, but can be validated using the UsdCollectionAPI::Validate()
/// method. 
/// 
/// All the properties authored by the schema are namespaced under
/// "collection:". The given name of the collection provides additional 
/// namespacing for the various per-collection properties, which include the 
/// following:
/// 
/// <ul><li><b>uniform token collection:<i>collectionName</i>:expansionRule</b> - 
/// specified how the paths that are included in the collection must be expanded 
/// to determine its members. Possible values include:
/// <ul>
/// <li><b>explicitOnly</b> - only paths in the includes rel targets and not 
/// in the excludes rel targets belong to the collection.
/// </li>
/// <li><b>expandPrims</b> - all the prims at or below the includes rel-
/// targets (and not under the excludes rel-targets) belong to the 
/// collection.  Any property paths included in the collection would, of 
/// course, also be honored. This is the default behavior as it satisfies 
/// most use cases.
/// </li>
/// <li><b>expandPrimsAndProperties</b> - like expandPrims, but also 
/// includes all properties on all matched prims.  We're still not quite 
/// sure what the use cases are for this, but you can use it to capture a 
/// whole lot of UsdObjects very concisely.
/// </li>
/// </ul>
/// </li>
/// <li><b>rel collection:<i>collectionName</i>:includes</b> - specifies a list 
/// of targets that are included in the collection. This can target prims or 
/// properties directly. A collection can include another collection by 
/// making its <i>includes</i> relationship target the <b>collection:{collectionName}</b> 
/// property on the owning prim of the collection to be included.
/// Such a property may not (and typically does not) exist on the UsdStage, but 
/// it is the path that is used to refer to the collection. When a collection 
/// When a collection includes one or more collections, the order in which 
/// targets are added to the includes relationship may become significant, if 
/// there are conflicting opinions about the same path. Targets that are added 
/// later are considered to be stronger than earlier targets. 
/// </li>
/// <li><b>rel collection:<i>collectionName</i>:excludes</b> - specifies a list 
/// of targets that are excluded below the <b>included</b> paths in this 
/// collection. This can target prims or properties directly, but <b>cannot
/// target another collection</b>. This is to keep the membership determining 
/// logic simple, efficient and easier to reason about. Finally, it is invalid 
/// for a collection to exclude paths that are not included in it. The presence
/// of such "orphaned" excluded paths will not affect the set of paths included 
/// in the collection, but may affect the performance of querying membership of 
/// a path in the collection (see UsdCollectionAPI::MembershipQuery::IsPathIncluded) 
/// or of enumerating the objects belonging to the collection (see 
/// UsdCollectionAPI::GetIncludedObjects).
