/// 
/// SetClipAssetPaths() establishes the set of clips that can be consulted.         
/// SetClipActive() specifies the ordering of clip application over time            
/// (clips can be repeated), while SetClipTimes() specifies time-mapping            
/// from stage-time to clip-time for the clip active at a given stage-time,         
/// which allows for time-dilation and repetition of clips.  Finally,           
/// SetClipPrimPath() determines the path within each clip that will map            
/// to this prim, i.e. the location within the clip at which we will look           
/// for opinions for this prim.         
/// 
/// Important facts about clips:            
/// li Within the layerstack in which clips are established, the           
/// opinions within the clips will be em weaker than any direct opinions           
/// in the layerstack, but em stronger than varying opinions coming across             
/// references and variants.            
/// li We will never look for metadata or default opinions in clips            
/// when performing value resolution on the owning stage, since these           
/// quantities must be time-invariant.          
/// 
/// This leads to the common structure in which we reference a model asset          
/// on a prim, and then author clips at the same site: the asset reference          
/// will provide the topology and unvarying data for the model, while           
/// the clips will provide the time-sampled animation.
