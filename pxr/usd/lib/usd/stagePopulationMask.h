/// \class UsdStagePopulationMask
///
/// This class represents a mask that may be applied to a UsdStage to limit the
/// set of UsdPrim s it populates.  This is useful in cases where clients have a
/// large scene but only wish to view or query a single or a handful of objects.
/// For example, suppose we have a city block with buildings, cars, crowds of
/// people, and a couple of main characters.  Some tasks might only require
/// looking at a single main character and perhaps a few props.  We can create a
/// population mask with the paths to the character and props of interest and
/// open a UsdStage with that mask.  Usd will avoid populating the other objects
/// in the scene, saving time and memory.  See UsdStage::OpenMasked() for more.
///
/// A mask is defined by a set of SdfPath s with the following qualities: they
/// are absolute prim paths (or the absolute root path), and no path in the set
/// is an ancestor path of any other path in the set other than itself.  For
/// example, the set of paths ['/a/b', '/a/c', '/x/y'] is a valid mask, but the
/// set of paths ['/a/b', '/a/b/c', '/x/y'] is redundant, since '/a/b' is an
/// ancestor of '/a/b/c'.  The path '/a/b/c' may be removed.  The GetUnion() and
/// Add() methods ensure that no redundant paths are added.
///
/// Default-constructed UsdStagePopulationMask s are considered empty
/// (IsEmpty()) and include no paths.  A population mask containing
/// SdfPath::AbsoluteRootPath() includes all paths.
