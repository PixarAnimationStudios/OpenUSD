    /// properties).  For example, if the path "/foo" is resynced, then all
    /// subpaths like "/foo/bar" and "/foo/bar.baz" may be arbitrarily changed.
    /// In contrast, "changed-info" means that a nonstructural change has
    /// occurred, like an attribute value change or a value change to a metadata
    /// field not related to composition.
    ///
    /// When a prim is resynced, say "/foo/bar", it might have been created or
    /// destroyed.  In that case "/foo"'s list of children will have changed,
    /// but we *do not* consider "/foo" to be resynced.  If we did, it would
    /// mean clients would have to consider all of "/foo/bar"'s siblings (and
    /// their descendants) to be resynced which might be egregious
    /// overinvalidation.

    /// in testing whether specific objects are affected by the changes should
    /// use the AffectedObject() method (and the ResyncedObject() and
