/// \class UsdReferences
///
/// UsdReferences provides an interface to authoring and introspecting
/// references in Usd.
///
/// References are the primary operator for "encapsulated aggregation" of
/// scene description. \em aggregation means that references allow us to
/// build up rich scenes by instancing scene description recorded in a
/// (most often) different file.  When we say "instancing" here, we mean
/// that we can reference the same file many times at different locations
/// in a scene's namespace.  Referenced scene description can be overridden
/// in the referencing (or stronger) layers, allowing each instance to be
/// directly specialized. \em Encapsulated means that regardless of how much
/// scene description is in the referenced file, only the scene description
/// under the targetted prim will be composed into the aggregate scene.
///
/// Some important facts about references and use of the UsdReferences API:
/// \li Any prim can host zero, one or multiple references 
/// \li References are \em list \em editable, that is, they compose differently
/// than ordinary properties and metadata.  In any given LayerStack, each 
/// authored reference operation at the same SdfPath location in each layer 
/// (i.e. on the same prim) will compose into an aggregate result by
/// adding to, removing from, or stomping "weaker" references.
/// \li References can only target <b>root prims</b> in referenced files; this
/// is validated at authoring-time.  Note that references may omit the root prim
/// path if they target layers that have the 'defaultPrim' layer metadata set.
/// See SdfLayer::GetDefaultPrim() and SdfLayer::SetDefaultPrim().  In this
/// case, the reference targets the 'defaultPrim' in the referenced layer.
/// \li References can target the same layer in which they are authored,
/// as long as doing so does not introduce a cycle in the composition graph
/// \li The \c identifier component of a reference in the provided API
/// can be a resolvable asset-path to some external file, empty, in which case 
/// the reference targets the root layer of the LayerStack containing the 
/// referencing layer, or the identifer of an existing anonymous, in-memory-only
/// SdfLayer.  Care should be exercised in the latter case: calling Export() on 
/// an anonymous layer to serialize it to a file will not attempt to replace 
/// any references to anonymous layers with references to file-backed layers.
/// \li Opinions brought in by reference on an ancestor prim are weaker than
/// opinions brought in by references on a descendant prim.
///
/// \anchor Usd_DefaultPrim_References
/// <b>Expressing references without prim paths.</b>
///
/// References may omit the target prim path if the referenced layer has the
/// 'defaultPrim' metadata set.  See SdfLayer::GetDefaultPrim(),
/// SdfLayer::SetDefaultPrim().  In that case, such a reference targets the
/// layer's specified default prim.
///
/// \anchor Usd_Internal_References
/// <b>Expressing references to the containing LayerStack.</b>
///
/// References may omit the identifier specifying the referenced layer.  This
/// creates an "internal" reference. During composition, the referenced layer 
/// will be resolved to the root layer of the LayerStack containing the 
/// layer where the reference was authored.
///
/// \anchor Usd_Failing_References
/// <b>Reasons why adding a reference may fail, why adding a reference may
/// succeed but still generate errors, and what it all means.</b>
///
/// Add() and SetItems() can each fail for a number of reasons.  If one of
/// the specified prim targets for one of the references is not a root prim,
/// we will generate an error, fail to author any scene description, and return
/// \c false.  If anything goes wrong in attempting to write the reference,
/// we also return false, and the reference will also remain unauthored.
/// Otherwise, if the reference was successfully authored, we will return true.
/// <b>A succesful reference authoring operation may still generate composition
/// errors!</b>  Just because the reference you specified was syntactically
/// correct and therefore successfully authored, does not imply it was
/// meaningful. If you wish to ensure that the reference you are about to
/// author will be meaningfully consumable by your stage, you are strongly
/// encouraged to <b>ensure it will resolve to an actual file by using
/// UsdStage::ResolveIdentifierToEditTarget() before authoring the reference.</b>
///
/// Immediately upon successful authoring of the reference (before returning
/// from Add(), Remove(), Clear(), or SetItems()), the UsdStage on which the
/// reference was authored will recompose the subtree rooted at the prim
/// hosting the reference.  If the provided identifer does not resolve to a
/// layer that is already opened or that can be opened in the usd format,
/// \em or if the provided primPath is not an actual root prim in that layer,
/// the stage's recomposition will fail, and pass on composition errors to the
/// client.
