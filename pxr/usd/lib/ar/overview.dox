\section ar_overview Overview

The Ar module defines a plugin point for asset resolution, an important
part of referenced scene description.  The interface class ArResolver
can be derived and customized for each installation of USD.  Each custom
implementation can also reason about its own ArResolverContext type,
which allows a singel process to access multiple different state-sets
(contexts) to guide asset resolution differently for different 
datasets/contexts.

Since resolving assets to filesystem paths can be expensive, and typically
clients (such as USD) will commonly attempt to resolve the same assets over 
and over again, we also provide an RAII ArResolverScopedCache that can
greatly speed up asset resolution by caching results.

Finally, if no custom implementation of ArResolver is found, we will fall back
to a ArDefaultResolver, which performs simple searchpath-based
resolution, based on an environment variable <tt>PXR_AR_DEFAULT_SEARCH_PATH</tt>
that is expected to hold a colon-separated list of filesystem paths to search.
