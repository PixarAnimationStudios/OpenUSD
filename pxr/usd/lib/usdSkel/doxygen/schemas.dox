\section UsdSkel_Schemas_Overview Overview

Data in UsdSkel is stored in modular, reusable, instanceable parts,
adhering to the following design principles:

- _Skeleton_ "rigs" can be defined and published, to be referenced in wherever
  needed. Encapsulating skeletons this way is not necessarily a requirement for
  the interchange of skeletal data, but facilitates scalability and
  maintainability when deploying directly-rendered, skinned crowds at scale
  in VFX pipelines.

- _Animations_ can be published individually and referenced back into scenes.
  This not only allows re-use, but also enables sequencing of animations as
  <a href="http://openusd.org/docs/USD-Glossary.html#USDGlossary-ValueClips">Value Clips</a>.

- Separating the binding of a _skeleton_ and its _animation_ as bound to
  geometry allows assets to be published with a bound _skeleton_, inside of
  a \ref Usd_ScenegraphInstancing_Overview "instance primitive", which can
  still be driven by a separate animation.

- All posing and animation data is vectorized. This encoding is concise and
  ideal for scalability and speed of data consumption in the USD APIs.

  Although vectorization may seem unnecessary to the client attempting to
  interchange individual models only, it is an important consideration for
  achieving a scalable encoding of crowds in VFX pipelines.

Following these principles, UsdSkel defines skeletal data using the following
schema types:

- \ref UsdSkel_SkelRoot "Skel Root":

  Identifies where in a scene graph skeletal processing takes place,
  in addition to providing bounds for skinned models.

- \ref UsdSkel_Skeleton "Skeleton":
  
  Defines the \ref UsdSkel_Term_SkeletonTopology "topology" of the skeleton,
  as well as storing a _rest pose_.

- \ref UsdSkel_Joint "Joint":
  
  Concrete prim type used when defining the \ref UsdSkel_JointHierarchy
  "joint hierarchy" of a skeleton.

- \ref UsdSkel_PackedJointAnimation "Packed Joint Animation":
  
  Stores animated joint transforms, which may be applied to any skeleton.

- \ref UsdSkel_BindingAPI "Binding API":

  API schema used to describe what skeletons affect which primitives,
  what animation sources drive the skeleton, as well as basic skinning
  properties like joint influences.

\section UsdSkel_JointOrder Joint Order

Joint data in UsdSkel is stored in vectorized arrays.
Throughout UsdSkel, these arrays may be ordered in slightly different ways.
For instance, a _skeleton_ has its own explicit joint ordering, but an
_animation_ may have another order, representing either a different
ordering of joints, or a sparse subset of joints.

These data orderings are referred to as a primitive's **joint order**, and
are defined using token arrays.

The tokens in a joint array are given as Sdf-style paths, where parent-child
relationships in the ggiven paths establish a
\ref UsdSkel_jointHierarch "joint hierarchy." Note that these paths do not
need to refer to actual primitives in the scene. They are used as a way to
name and order joints in vectorized data. For example:

\code
def PackedJointAnimation "Anim" {
    uniform token[] = ["A", "A/B"]
}
def Skeleton "Skel" {
    uniform token[] = ["A/B", "A"]
}
\endcode

Note that in both example primitives above, the given paths do not reference
any real primitives. Also note that each primitive has its own joint ordering,
and that those orders need not be identical.

The purpose of encoding orderings in this manner to allow for the creation
of **self-contained** assets. For example, it is possible to construct
a \ref UsdSkel_PackedJointAnimation "packed joint animation" primitive
independently from any skeleton definitions, which will remain valid even if a
_skeleton_ that the animation is mapped to has a slightly different ordering.

Part of the motivation for this is to allow for more robust, composed assets.
When orderings are required to remain fixed, maintenance difficulties
may arise. For example, if animation assets are produced through a process
independent from the process that produces a shared definition of a
_skeleton asset_, data can easily get out of sync.

On top of allowing for more robust assets, these flexible joint orderings allow
for additional features like sparse authoring of animation data.

Data can be remapped from one joint ordering to another using a
UsdSkelAnimMapper, and is done so by matching joint names.

\section UsdSkel_SkelRoot Skeleton Root Schema

The UsdSkelRoot schema is used to **encapsulate** primitives with
skelelal skinning behaviors, and is required when authoring skeletal data.

A SkelRoot is a boundable primitive, and provides a place to encode the
extents of all skinned primitives beneath it. It is neither expected nor
required the descendent primitives that are being skinned will encode
their own skinned extents.

A SkelRoot additionally gives DCC apps a way of identifying which parts of a
scene graph require skeletal processing, so that they can take different code
paths, as is often required to consume skeletal data.

Because a UsdSkelRoot prim encapsulates skeletal behavior, it is also the case
that the inherited bindings set through the \ref UsdSkel_BindingAPI
"Binding API Schema" have no effect when set on primitives that do not have
a UsdSkelRoot primitive as one of their ancestors.

It is possible to override a primitive's composed type in USD, in order
to either enable or disable skeletal processing. For example:

\code{.cpp}
    // Enable skeletal processing by setting the type to UsdSkelRoot.
    UsdSkel.Root.Define(prim.GetStage(), prim.GetPath());
    // Disable skeletal processing by changing the type to a normal transform.
    UsdGeomTransform.Define(prim.GetStage(), prim.GetPath());
\endcode

\section UsdSkel_Skeleton Skeleton Schema

The UsdSkelSkeleton schema describes a skeleton. This schema is responsible
both for establishing the _topology_ of a skeleton, as well as for identifying
a _rest pose_.

A skeleton itself provides only structure. Meshes are posed with a skeleton
by way of \ref UsdSkel_BindingAPI "skeletal bindings" inside of 
the "geometry hierarchy" of primitives.

\subsection UsdSkel_JointHierarchy Skeleton: Joint Hierarchy

The joints of a Skeleton are defined by the _joints_ attribute. This attribute
encodes joints paths -- which must be valid SdfPath strings. The parent-child
relationships of these paths establish parent-child relationships.

For example:

\code
def Skeleton "Skel" {
    uniform token[] joints = ["A", "A/B",  "C", "C/D/E"]
}

In the above example, there are four joints:
- `A`: A root joint (no parent)
- `A/B`: A joint parented beneath joint `A`
- `C`: Another root joint (no parent). There can be any number of root joints.
- `C/D/E`: A joint which, since `C/D` has not been defined, will be parented
   beneath joint `C`.

In addition to providing parent-child relationships, this token array also
establishes the \ref UsdSkel_JointOrder "joint order" of the skeleton.

The targets of the _joints_ attribute are required to be authored such
that all parent joints come before any of their children in the array.
This is a requirement because it simplifies some computations without
necessitating the creation of additional data structures. This ordering
can most easily be achieved by simply sorting the array.

It's possible to test whether or not an array of joint paths defines a
valid topology as follows:

\code{.cpp}
std::string whyNot;
bool isValid = UsdSkelTopology(paths).Validate(&whyNot);
\endcode

\section UsdSkel_PackedJointAnimation Packed Joint Animation Schema

Schema describing vectorized joint animation data.

Both as a storage optimization and to allow for value interpolation that
preserves transform orthogonality, joint transforms are encoded as separate
translate, rotate and scale components, given in _joint local_ space.
Transforms are constructed from components using an order of
scale-rotate-translate. Client code may make use of the
\ref UsdSkel_TransformCompositionUtils "transform composition utilities" for
converting transforms to and from this component form.

Joint data is stored in arrays, using the \ref UsdSkel_JointOrder
"joint order" specified by the _joints_ attribute. This ordering may be
different from the Skeletons that the animation maps to, and may also
only identify a sparse subset of the joints in a skeleton. When an animation
provides sparse data, fallback values are taken from the rest pose on the
UsdSkelSkeleton primitive to which they apply.

\subsection Animation Root Transform

A PackedJointAnimation is itself a UsdGeomXformable primitive, and may specify
a local transformation. If such a local transform is defined, it provides
a root transformation for the entire animation.

This is separate from the root transformation of the 
\ref UsdSkel_Term_SkeletonInstance "Skeleton Instance", and provides a way of
making a distintion between the component of a character's _clip_ motion, and
the model's own local-to-world transform.

\section UsdSkel_BindingAPI Binding API Schema

The UsdSkelBindingAPI schema provides a means of binding a _Skeleton_ into
a geometry hierarchy. This schema is also responsible for defining joint
influences, as well as an optional _geomBindTransform_ property to define
the space for skinning.

Since a UsdSkelRoot primitive provides encapsulation of skeletal data, bindings
defined on any primitives that do not have a UsdSkelRoot primitive as one of
their ancestors have no meaning, and should be ignored.

\sa \ref UsdSkel_CodingExamples "Coding examples for reading skel data"

\subsection UsdSkel_BindingAPI_Skeletons BindingAPI: Binding Skeletons

Meshes are skinned based on \ref UsdSkel_Term_SkinningTransform
"skinning transforms", computed from a UsdSkelSkeletonQuery, which is bound
hierarchically using the _skel:skeleton_ relationship. The transforms for
a bound skeleton are driven from an animation source, such as a
 \ref UsdSkel_PackedJointAnimation "packed joint animation", which is
also bound hierarchically, via the _skel:animationSource_ binding relationship.

By defining bindings hierarchically, it is possible to define models that
each have unique skeletal animations, while also being
\ref Usd_ScenegraphInstancing_Overview "instanced".
For example:

\code
def "Character" {
    rel skel:skeleton = <Skel>
    def Skeleton "Skel" {}
}

def PackedJointAnimation "Anim" {}

over "Instance" (
    prepend references = </Character>
    instanceable=true
) {
    rel skel:animationSource = </Anim>
}
\endcode

Each _skel:skeleton_ binding may be thought of as identifying a
\ref UsdSkel_Term_SkeletonInstance "Skeleton Instance", animated
according to whichever inherited _skel:animationSource_ is defined at the
location at which the _skel:skeleton_ is bound.

Although _skel:animationSource_ bindings are inherited, they only apply
when a _skel:skeleton_ is resolved. For example:

\code
over "A" {
    rel skel:animationSource = </Anim>

    over "B" {
       rel skel:skeleton = </Skel1>
    }
    over "C" {
        rel skel:skeleton = </Skel2>
    }
}
\endcode

The above example includes two separate _skeleton instances_, with the
same animation being applied to each instance. Contrast that with the
following case:

\code
over "A" {
    rel skel:skeleton = </Skel>

    over "B" {
       rel skel:animationSource = </Anim1>
    }
    over "C" {
        rel skel:animationSource = </Anim2>
    }
}
\endcode

In the above example, there is only a single _skeleton instance_ 
(at `</A>`), which has no animation, because a _skel:animationSource_
binding is not considered to have any effect until the next
_skel:skeleton_ binding at or beneath the binding location in namespace.

One final example may clarify behavior:

\code
over "A" {
    rel skel:skeleton = </Skel>
    rel skel:animationSource = </Anim1>    

    over "B" {
        rel skel:animationSource = </Anim2>
    }
    over "C" {
        rel skel:animationSource = </Anim2>
        rel skel:skeleton = </Skel>
    }
}
\endcode

In this case, there are two _skeleton instances_: One at `</A>`, referencing
the animation at `</Anim1>`, and one at `</A/C>`, referencing the animation
at `</Anim2>`. The _skel:animationSource_ relationship at `</A/B>` has no
effect.

\subsection UsdSkel_BindingAPI_JointInfluences BindingAPI: Joint Influences

Joint influences for skinning points are defined via primvars,
_primvars:skel:jointIndices_ and _primvars:skel:jointWeights_.
The _jointIndices_ primvar provides an array giving the joint index of an
influence, while the _jointWeights_ primvar provides a weight value
corresponding to each of those indices.

The indices in the _jointIndices_ primvar refer to joints based on the
bound \ref UsdSkel_JointOrder "joint order". If the _skel:joints_
attribute has been set, each index refers to the corresponding target
of that token array. Otherwise, each index refers to a joint using the
joint order of the bound _Skeleton_.

In the common case, these primvars are configured with _vertex_ interpolation,
and provide a run of N influences per point, where N is the _elementSize_
of the primvars. See UsdGeomPrimvar for more information on the meaning
of primvar interpolation and elementSize.

No restrictions are placed on the _elementSize_ when defining joint influences.
Because such a limit may vary among different DCC applications, we feel that
it is inappropriate to hard-code any such restrictions at the file storage
level. Instead, for clients that require a strict limit on the number of
influences per point, UsdSkel provides helper method,
\ref UsdSkelResizeInfluences, that can be used to enforce such limits
within each client, as necessary.


See the \ref UsdSkel_CE_Skinning "skinning coding examples" for an example
of how resolved joint influences may be read.


\subsection UsdSkel_BindingAPI_RigidDeformations BindingAPI: Rigid Deformations

In addition to defining influences that vary per point, joint influences may be
also defined with _constant_ interpolation. In this form, the _jointIndices_
and _jointWeights_ arrays hold N scalar values, which apply to all points.
Constant joint influences are supported both as a form of storage optimization,
as well as for the sake of encoding _rigid deformations_. By identifying
rigid deformations, some clients may be able to retain instancing properties
that would otherwise be lost by skinning, by affecting only the transform of
an instance rather than the deforming points of that instance.

It is not expected that all clients know how to deal with rigid deformations.
For those clients that don't understand rigid deformations, UsdSkel provides
helper methods UsdSkelSkinningQuery::ComputeVaryingJointInfluences and
\ref UsdSkelExpandConstantInfluencesToVarying which both provide a means of
querying rigid deformations as if they had been encoded with influences
per-point.

\subsection UsdSkel_BindingAPI_StoringInfluences BindingAPI: Storing Influences

To ensure correct skinning, joint influences should be normalized when they
are written using the UsdSkelBindingAPI. UsdSkel does *not* automatically
normalize weights when reading data. Clients should instead use the
\ref UsdSkelNormalizeWeights helper method to normalize weights prior to
storing them.

Additionally, as part of our \ref UsdSkel_BestPractices "best practices",
we suggest that joint influences be sorted from largest weight value to
smallest. The \ref UsdSkelSortInfluences utility can be used to do so.
UsdSkel does not currently *require* sorted joint influences, but may later
add such restrictions, since they enable some skinning optimizations like 
\ref UsdSkelResizeInfluences.
