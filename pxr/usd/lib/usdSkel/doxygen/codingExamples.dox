This page provides some basic coding patterns for interacting with UsdSkel data.

\section UsdSkel_CE_PopulateCache Populating a UsdSkelCache

As discussed in the \ref UsdSkel_OM "object model", a UsdSkelSkeletonQuery
object is associated with each bound \ref UsdSkel_Term_SkeletonInstance
"skeleton instance". These queries are pre-populated on a UsdSkelCache,
which resolves the inherited UsdSkelBindingAPI properties to reason
about resolved skel state.

Before any of these queries can be accessed, a UsdSkelCache must first
be constructed, and populated for a given skel root.

The following code shows how this can be done in the following manner;

- C++:
\code{.cpp}
UsdSkelCache cache;
cache.Populate(UsdSkelRoot(skelRootPrim));
\endcode

- Python:
\code{.py}
cache = UsdSkel.Cache()
cache.Populate(UsdSkel.Root(skelRootPrim))
\endcode

The UsdSkelCache instance is intended to be **shared** and to **persist** over
the lifetime of a process that is consuming skeletal data. A cache may
be populated with any number of skel roots.

\note Cache population is thread-safe, and may be populated in parallel.

When populating a cache, the cache is populated with a UsdSkelRoot prim.
A UsdSkelRoot provides encapsulation of skeletal data in a scene hierarchy,
so this serves as the obvious choice for where to begin population.

If it was desired that all skel roots be pre-populated on a stage, that
could be done as follows:

- C++:
\snippet examples.cpp PopulateAllSkelRoots

- Python:
\snippet examples.py PopulateAllSkelRoots


\section UsdSkel_CE_AccessingSkels Accessing Skels

Once a cache has been populated beneath a UsdSkelRoot, we can search for
\ref UsdSkel_Term_SkeletonInstance "skeleton instances" bound at or beneath
that root -- given as UsdSkelSkeletonQuery objects.

The following code shows how _skeleton instances_, and the prims
at which they are bound, can be discovered as:

- C++:
\snippet examples.cpp FindSkels

- Python (as an iterator):
\snippet examples.py IterSkels


\section UsdSkel_CE_FindSkinnables Finding Skinnable Prims

If a primitive is skinnable, then UsdSkelCache::GetSkinningQuery will
return a valid query object that can be used for querying skinning
information for that primitive. The query will only be valid if there are no
validation errors in the UsdSkelBindingAPI properties that control skinning,
and if the joint influences are fully defined. Joint influences are
fully defined if both the _primvars:skel:jointIndices_ and
_primvars:skel:jointWeights_ primvars are defined and valid.

Once a cache has been populated, we can check if a prim is skinnable as follows:

- C++:
\code{.cpp}
bool isSkinnable = (bool)cache.GetSkinningQuery(prim);
\endcode

- Python:
\code{.py}
isSkinnable = bool(cache.GetSkinningQuery(prim))
\endcode

The _skeleton instance_ that corresponds to each skinnable primitive is the
instance bound at the same primitive, or at the nearest ancestor above.
Usually it is expected that the set of _skeleton instances_ and the
prims that they skin will be discovered through a top-down hierarchy traversal.
But we can also discover the skeleton that affects a given skinnable prim
using UsdSkelCache::GetInheritedSkelQuery.

UsdSkelCache::ComputeSkinnedPrims is often used to collect the set of skinnable
primitives that correspond to a given skeleton. For example usage, the following
code shows how we can traverse beneath a skel root to print out each bound
skeleton, and the set of skinnable primitives that it affects:

- C++:
\snippet examples.cpp PrintSkelsAndSkinnedPrims

- Python:
\snippet examples.py PrintSkelsAndSkinnedPrims

\sa \ref UsdSkel_SkinnablePrims


\section UsdSkel_CE_Skinning Skinning

Once a skeleton instance and skinnable primitive have been identified --
as a UsdSkelSkeletonQuery and a UsdSkelSkinningQuery, respectively --
we can start applying skinning.

It is generally expected that skinning information is transferred into some
other data structure on the client's end. A client might apply skinning on
a GPU, or have existing data structures that apply skinning.

However, in the interests of clarifying behavior, the following code shows
how skinned points can be computed for a UsdGeomPointBased
(in _skeleton space_):

- C++:
\snippet examples.cpp ComputeSkinnedPoints

- Python:
\snippet examples.py ComputeSkinnedPoints

It's important to keep in mind that these examples do _not_ demonstrate
_efficient_ patterns for applying skinning. For best efficiency, the
skinning transforms of a skeleton, as computed by
UsdSkelSkeletonQuery::ComputeSkinningTransforms, should be computed once per
time sample, with the results being shared by all primitives that are skinned
by that skeleton. Further, it is also a good idea for clients to cache the
entire _rest_ state of skinned primitives -- including their joint influences
and binding transforms -- and reuse that rest state while applying posing
across different time samples. The UsdSkelSkinningQuery::ComputeSkinnedPoints
and UsdSkelSkinningQuery::ComputeSkinnedTransform helpers exist primarily
to apply a convenient facility for computing skinned data for validation and
debugging purposes, and should not necessarily be used in performance-sensitive
contexts.

Code for skinning transforms (in _skeleton space_)
-- I.e., computing rigid deformations -- is similar:

- C++:
\snippet examples.cpp ComputeSkinnedTransform

- Python:
\snippet examples.py ComputeSkinnedTransform

For a more complete look at how skeletal data is used to apply skinning, see
the implementation of \ref UsdSkelBakeSkinningLBS, which provides a complete
reference implementation of skinning, for testing and validation.
