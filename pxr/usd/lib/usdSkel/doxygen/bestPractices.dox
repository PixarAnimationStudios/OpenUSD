\section UsdSkel_BP_TransformDecomposition Transform Decomposition

UsdSkel provides its own transform decomposition method, 
\ref UsdSkelDecomposeTransforms, for decomposing a transform into translate,
rotate and scale components.

Clients may have their own transform decomposition methods with slightly
different behavior. As long as \ref UsdSkelMakeTransforms returns the correct
results, using alternative decomposition methods is _fine_.

However, it is important that the results of decomposition methods are
not mixed. Two decomposition methods may produce different translate,
rotate and scale components, but that recombine to form the same transforms,
so it may not be valid to set, say, rotations but not translations.

To avoid hard to debug transform composition issues, it is recommended that
whenever any of the transform components is set on a UsdSkelPackedJointAnimation
primitive, **all** of the components are set.

\section UsdSkel_BP_CreatingPrimvars Creating Primvars

When creating primvars using the UsdSkelBindingAPI, it is good practice
to **always** specify both the primvar _interpolation_ and _elementSize_.
Otherwise, it is very easy to end up with invalid data in a composed scene.

Users are encouraged to use the UsdSkelBindingAPI::CreateJointIndicesPrimvar and
UsdSkelBindingAPI::CreateJointWeightsPrimvar helper methods, which ensure that
those properties are always correctly defined.

\section UsdSkel_BP_SkinnedPrimTypes Skinned Prim Types

It's easy to fall into the trap of assuming that all \ref UsdSkel_SkinnablePrims
"skinnable prims" will be UsdGeomMesh types, or similar. This is not true: any
UsdGeomBoundable primitive may be treated as being skinnable. It is the client's
responsibility to determine if they know how to skin a given primitive.

\section UsdSkel_BP_NumInfluences Number of Influences

Clients should not assume that the number of influences -- I.e,. the primvar
_elementSize_ --  will be within some threshold that they consider _reasonable_.
If it is desired that a maximum number of influences be enforced, the client
should enforce that by truncating the resulting influences themselves. The
\ref UsdSkelResizeInfluences helper method may be used towards that end.

\section UsdSkel_BP_JointInfluences Joint Influences

UsdSkel does not currently require joint weighting to be normalized, or sorted.
It is, however, recommended. This can be done prior to writing data to USD
using the \ref UsdSkelNormalizeWeights and \ref UsdSkelSortInfluences helper
methods.
