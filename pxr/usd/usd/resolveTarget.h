/// \class UsdResolveTarget
///
/// Defines a subrange of nodes and layers within a prim's prim index to 
/// consider when performing value resolution for the prim's attributes.
/// A resolve target can then be passed to UsdAttributeQuery during its 
/// construction to have all of the queries made by the UsdAttributeQuery use
/// the resolve target's subrange for their value resolution.
///
/// Resolve targets can be created via methods on UsdPrimCompositionQueryArc to
/// to limit value resolution to a subrange of the prim's composed specs that 
/// are \ref UsdPrimCompositionQueryArc::MakeResolveTargetUpTo "no stronger that arc", 
/// or a subrange of specs that is 
/// \ref UsdPrimCompositionQueryArc::MakeResolveTargetStrongerThan "strictly stronger than that arc" 
/// (optionally providing a particular layer within the arc's layer stack to 
/// further limit the range of specs). 
///
/// Alternatively, resolve targets can also be created via methods on UsdPrim
/// that can limit value resolution to either 
/// \ref UsdPrim::MakeResolveTargetUpToEditTarget "up to" or 
/// \ref UsdPrim::MakeResolveTargetStrongerThanEditTarget "stronger than" 
/// the spec that would be edited when setting a value for the prim using the
/// given UsdEditTarget.
///
/// Unlike UsdEditTarget, a UsdResolveTarget is only relevant to the prim it
/// is created for and can only be used in a UsdAttributeQuery for attributes 
/// on this prim.

/// \section Invalidation
/// This object does not listen for change notification.  If a consumer is
/// holding on to a UsdResolveTarget, it is their responsibility to dispose
/// of it in response to a resync change to the associated prim. 
/// Failing to do so may result in incorrect values or crashes due to 
/// dereferencing invalid objects.
