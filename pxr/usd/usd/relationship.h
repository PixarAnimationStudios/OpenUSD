class UsdRelationship;

/// A std::vector of UsdRelationships.
typedef std::vector<UsdRelationship> UsdRelationshipVector;

/// \class UsdRelationship
///
/// A UsdRelationship creates dependencies between scenegraph objects by 
/// allowing a prim to \em target other prims, attributes, or relationships.
///
/// \section usd_relationship_chars Relationship Characteristics
///
/// A UsdRelationship is a pointer to other objects, which are named by their
/// scenegraph paths.  When authoring relationships, the \em target parameters
/// should be scenegraph paths in the composed namespace of the UsdStage into
/// which you are authoring.  If your edits are targetted to a different
/// layer, across various composition arcs (because you specified a non-default
/// \ref UsdEditTarget), the target's path will be automatically translated
/// into the proper namespace.
///
/// A single UsdRelationship can target multiple other objects, which can be 
/// of UsdPrim, UsdAttribute, or UsdRelationship type.  UsdRelationship
/// participates in "list editing", which means that stronger layers in a
/// composed scene can add, remove, or reorder targets authored on the
/// relationship in weaker layers \em without stomping the weaker opinions,
/// although stomping behavior is still possible, via SetTargets().
///
/// An authored relationship creates a dependency of the targetting prim on
/// the targetted prim(s).  We consider these dependencies to be "load
/// dependencies", which means that when we load the targeting prim's
/// "load group", we will also load the targetted prims' load groups, to ensure
/// that all the data required to render the model containing the targeting
/// prim is composed and available.
///
/// Like UsdAttribute, UsdRelationship objects are meant to be ephemeral,
/// live on the stack, and be cheap to refetch from their owning UsdPrim.
///
/// Unlike UsdAttribute s, which can either be uniform over all time
/// or vary in value over time, UsdRelationship is <b>always uniform</b>.
/// 
/// \section usd_relationship_restrictions Relationship Restrictions
///
/// When authoring relationship targets in a stage's local LayerStack,
/// all target paths are legal (Note we may restrict this prior to launch
/// to only allowing targeting of already-extant scenegraph objects).  However,
/// a relationship target that is legal in a local LayerStack may become
/// unreachable when the stage's root layer is \em referenced into an 
/// aggregate, and will cause an error when attempting to load/compose
/// the aggregate.
///
/// This can happen because references encapsulate just the tree whose root
/// is targetted in the reference - no other scene description in the
/// referenced layer will be composed into the aggregate.  So if some
/// descendant prim of the referenced root targets a relationship to another
/// tree in the same layer, that relationship would dangle, and the client
/// will error in GetTargets() or GetForwardedTargets().
///
/// Authoring targets to objects within masters is not allowed, since master
/// prims do not have a stable identity across runs.  Consumers must author
/// targets to the object within an instance instead.
///
/// Relationships authored in a descendent prim of a referenced prim may not
/// target the referenced prim itself or any of its immediate child properties
/// if the referencing prim is instanceable.  Allowing this would break the
/// ability for this relationship to be instanced and shared by multiple
/// instances -- it would force consumers of relationships within masters
/// to resolve targets in the context of each of that master's instances.
///
/// \section usd_relationship_forwarding Relationship Forwarding
///
/// Because a relationship can target another relationship, we can and do
/// provide the ability to resolve chained or \em forwarded relationships.
/// This can be useful in several situations, including:
///
/// \li Combining relationships with VariantSets to create demultiplexers.
///     A prim can host a relationship that serves as a "binding post" for
///     other prims to target.  The prim also hosts a "bindingVariant"
///     UsdVariantSet whose variants each modulate the target of the
///     binding-post relationship.  We can now change the \em forwarded target 
///     of all prims targetting the binding-post by simply switching the
///     bindingVariant VariantSet.  We will work through this example in
///     the USD reference manual.
/// \li Defining a relationship as part of a model's interface (so that it can
///     be targetted in model hierarchy with no models loaded), which, inside
///     the model's payload, forwards to prims useful to a client, the set of
///     which may vary depending on the model's configured VariantSets.
///
