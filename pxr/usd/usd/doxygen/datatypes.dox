\section Usd_Datatypes Attribute value types

USD supports a variety of data types for attribute values. 
These types are encoded in an SdfValueTypeName object that corresponds to an 
underlying C++ type and is what a user would receive from a call to 
UsdAttribute::GetTypeName. Methods for looking up these objects are provided 
by \c SdfSchema and they're enumerated in the 
object \c SdfValueTypeNames -- \sa SdfSchema

For example, to create a custom, Matrix4d-valued attribute on prim \em foo:
\code
if (UsdAttribute mat = foo.CreateAttribute(TfToken("myMatrix"), SdfValueTypeNames->Matrix4d)){
   mat.Set(GfMatrix4d(1));  // Assign identity matrix
} else {
   // error creating the attribute
}
\endcode
In python:
\code{.py}
mat = foo.CreateAttribute("myMatrix", Sdf.ValueTypeNames.Matrix4d)
if mat:
   mat.Set(Gf.Matrix4d(1))  # Assign identity matrix
else:
   # error creating the attribute
\endcode

\section Usd_Roles Roles

Value types may also be specified by one of a set of special type names. 
These names correspond to the basic data types listed above but provide 
extra semantics about how the data should be interpreted. For instance, 
a value of type "frame4d" is a GfMatrix4d, but represents a coordinate frame.

These type names are grouped by a "role" name, such that all types with the 
same role have the same semantics. All of these "semantic types" 
are also provided in SdfValueTypeNames

| Value type token  | Underlying type | Role name         | Role Meaning                                        |

| texCoord3f        | Vec3f           | TextureCoordinate | 3D uvw texture coordinate 

The following exist for historical/internal reasons, 
but we expect to eliminate them prior to open-sourcing.

| Value type token  | Underlying type | Role name  |
|:------------------|:----------------|:-----------|
| Transform         | Matrix4d        | Transform  |
| PointIndex        | int             | PointIndex |
| EdgeIndex         | Vec2i           | EdgeIndex  |
| FaceIndex         | int             | FaceIndex  |

\section Usd_Array_Datatypes Array data types

USD also supports arrays of the above data types. The value type 
name for these arrays is simply the name of the underlying value type 
and "[]", e.g. "bool[]", "float[]", etc., and are also provided by 
SdfValueTypeNames with a "Array" suffix on the basic datatype 
(e.g. SdfValueTypeNames->FloatArray provides "float[]"). 
The corresponding C++ type is VtArray, e.g. VtArray<bool>, VtArray<float>, etc.

\section Usd_Dictionary_Type Dictionary-valued Metadata

Metadata in USD (See \ref Usd_OM_Metadata) can take on several other datatypes.  
Most of these are highly-specialized, pertaining to composition, 
like SdfListOp<SdfReference>, but we also provide one very versatile 
datatype <b>dictionary</b> <em>that can only be assumed by metadata</em>, 
such as \ref UsdObject::GetCustomData() "customData". A dictionary's entries 
are keyed by string, and can take on any other scene description value type, 
\em including dictionary, allowing for nested dictionaries.

Dictionaries have special value-resolution semantics, in that each field 
resolves independently of all others, allowing dictionaries to be sparsely 
described and overridden in many layers.  This behavior, which we have 
found highly desirable, also makes dictionaries more expensive to fully 
compose than all other value types (except those that 
are \ref Usd_OM_ListOps "list-edited").  It is for this reason that we 
disallow dictionary as a value type for attributes: it would eliminate 
the extremely important performance characteristic of attribute 
value resolution that "strongest opinion wins".

You can use the builtin customData for your truly ad-hoc user-data needs, 
but you can also add new dictionary-valued metadata by defining it in a 
module plugInfo.json file - 
see \ref sdf_plugin_metadata for details on how to do so.
