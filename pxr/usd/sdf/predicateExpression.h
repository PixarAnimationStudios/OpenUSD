/// \class SdfPredicateExpression
///
/// Represents a logical expression syntax tree consisting of predicate function
/// calls joined by the logical operators 'and', 'or', 'not', and an implied-and
/// operator that represents two subexpressions joined by only whitespace.
///
/// An SdfPredicateExpression can be constructed with a string, which will parse
/// an expression.  The syntax for an expression is as follows:
///
/// The fundamental building blocks are calls to predicate functions.  There are
/// three syntaxes for function calls.
///
/// \li Bare call: just a function name: `isDefined`
/// \li Colon call: name, colon, positional arguments: `isa:mammal,bird`
/// \li Paren call: name and parenthesized positional and keyword args:
/// `isClose(1.23, tolerance=0.01)`
///
/// Colon call arguments are all positional and must be separated by commas with
/// no spaces between arguments. In paren calls, positional arguments must
/// precede keyword arguments, and whitespace is allowed between arguments.
///
/// The string parser supports argument values of the following types:
/// double-quoted "strings", unquoted strings, integers, floating-point numbers,
/// and boolean values 'true' and 'false'.
///
/// The unary operator 'not' may appear preceding a function call, or a
/// subexpresion enclosed in parentheses. The binary operators 'and' and 'or'
/// may appear between subexpressions. If subexpressions appear adjacent to each
/// other (other than possible whitespace), this is considered an implied 'and'
/// operator.
///
/// Operator precedence in order from highest to lowest is: 'not',
/// <implied-and>, 'and', 'or'.
///
/// Here are some examples of valid predicate expression syntax:
///
/// \li `foo` (call "foo" with no arguments)
/// \li `foo bar` (implicit 'and' of "foo" and "bar")
/// \li `foo not bar` (implicit 'and' of "foo" and "not bar")
/// \li `color:red (shiny or matte)`
/// \li `animal or mineral or vegetable`
/// \li `(mammal or bird) and (tame or small)`
/// \li `isClose(100, tolerance=3.0) or negative`
///
