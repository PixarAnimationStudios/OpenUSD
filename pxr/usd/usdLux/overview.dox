\section usdLux_overview Overview

UsdLux provides a representation for lights and related components that
are common to many graphics environments and therefore suitable for
interchange.

The goal of UsdLux is to serve as a basis for:

- passing lighting setups from a creation environment to a renderer
- best-effort portability of setups across environments, to the degree
  that they share capabilities

The UsdLux core includes:

- common light types
    - UsdLuxCylinderLight
    - UsdLuxDiskLight
    - UsdLuxDistantLight
    - UsdLuxDomeLight
    - UsdLuxRectLight
    - UsdLuxSphereLight
- common light attributes
    - \a power: intensity and exposure
    - \a color: as RGB components and/or color temperature
- base classes for common lights
    - UsdLuxBoundableLightBase: lights that inherit from UsdGeomBoundable
    - UsdLuxNonboundableLightBase:  lights that inherit from UsdGeomXformable
- API classes for imparting the behavior of "being a light" to any 
  UsdGeomXformable derived prim type
    - UsdLuxLightAPI: makes a prim "be a light" and adds common light attributes
    - UsdLuxMeshLightAPI: extends UsdLuxLightAPI for application to UsdGeomMesh
    - UsdLuxVolumeLightAPI: extends UsdLuxLightAPI for application to UsdVolVolume
- API classes embodying more complex behaviors
    - UsdLuxLightListAPI: light component enumeration and discovery
    - UsdCollectionAPI: light-object linking
    - UsdLuxShadowAPI: shadow-linking and falloff
    - UsdLuxShapingAPI: focus, cone angle, and IES profiles
- associated components for adjusting behavior
    - UsdLuxLightFilter: a filter to modulate the effect of lights
    - UsdLuxPortalLight: a portal to guide sampling of a dome light
- \ref usdLux_PluginSchemas "plugin types":
    - UsdLuxPluginLight
    - UsdLuxPluginLightFilter

This core can be extended to add more types of lights, filters, or other features.

\section usdLux_Notes Design Notes and Usage Guide

\subsection usdLux_LightAPIAndBeingALight LightAPI and "Being a Light"

UsdLuxLightAPI defines all the common attributes and behaviors that are 
considered to be core to all lights. Thus, we define a _UsdLux light_ as any 
prim that has a UsdLuxLightAPI applied. In other words, applying a 
UsdLuxLightAPI imparts the quality of "being a light" to a prim.

Most light types, such as UsdLuxRectLight or any type that inherits from 
UsdLuxBoundableLightBase or UsdLuxNonboundableLightBase, have an applied 
UsdLuxLightAPI automatically \ref Usd_BuiltinAPISchemas "built in" to their type
and therefore will always be lights. However, by attaching the quality of being 
a light to an applied API schema, we can turn any geometry into a light by 
applying a UsdLuxLightAPI to it, or, as we would in the case of a UsdGeomMesh 
to which we'd apply UsdLuxMeshLightAPI, by applying an API schema that itself 
has a built-in UsdLuxLightAPI.

\subsection usdLux_Geometry Geometry

By convention, lights with a primary axis emit along -Z.
Area lights are centered in the XY plane and are 1 unit in diameter.

UsdLux objects are UsdGeomXformable, so they use its set of
transform operators, and inherit transforms hierarchically.
It is recommended that only translation and rotations be used
with the lights, to avoid introducing difficulties for light sampling
and integration.  Lights have explicit attributes to adjust their size.

UsdLux provides the UsdLuxLightAPI, which can be applied to arbitrary 
user-supplied geometry, as well as concrete lights for specific shapes: spheres,
rectangles, disks, and cylinders.  The specific shapes exist because they can 
support superior, analytic sampling methods.

UsdLux is designed primarily for physically-based cinematic lighting with
area lights.  Accordingly, it does not include zero-area point or line
lights.  However, some backends benefit from a point or line approximation.
This intent can be indicated using the treatAsPoint and treatAsLine
attributes on UsdSphereLight and UsdCylinderLight.  These attributes
are hints that avoid the need for backends to use heuristics (such as
an arbitrary epsilon threshold) to determine the approximation. These
hints can be set at the time of creation (or export) where the most
information about the visual intent exists.

UsdLux does not provide support for expressing live transform
constraints, such as to attach lights to moving geometry.  This is
consistent with USD's policy of storing the computed result of rigging,
not the rigging itself.

\subsection usdLux_quantities Quantities and Units

Most renderers consuming OpenUSD today are RGB renderers, rather than spectral.
Units in RGB renderers are tricky to define as each of the red, green and blue
channels transported by the renderer represents the convolution of a spectral
exposure distribution, e.g. CIE Illuminant D65, with a sensor response function,
e.g. CIE 1931 𝓍̅. Thus the main quantity in an RGB renderer is neither radiance
nor luminance, but "integrated radiance" or "tristimulus weight".

The emission of a default light with `intensity` 1 and `color` [1, 1, 1] is an
Illuminant D spectral distribution with chromaticity matching the rendering
color space white point, normalized such that a ray normally incident upon the
sensor with EV0 exposure settings will generate a pixel value of [1, 1, 1] in
the rendering color space.

Given the above definition, that means that the luminance of said default light
will be 1 *nit (cd∕m²)* and its emission spectral radiance distribution is
easily computed by appropriate normalization.

For brevity, the term *emission* will be used in the documentation to mean
"emitted spectral radiance" or "emitted integrated radiance/tristimulus weight",
as appropriate.

The method of "uplifting" an RGB color to a spectral distribution is unspecified
other than that it should round-trip under the rendering illuminant to the
limits of numerical accuracy.

Note that some color spaces, most notably ACES, define their white points by
chromaticity coordinates that do not exactly line up to any value of a standard
illuminant. Because we do not define the method of uplift beyond the round-
tripping requirement, we discourage the use of such color spaces as the
rendering color space, and instead encourage the use of color spaces whose white
point has a well-defined spectral representation, such as D65.

\subsubsection usdLux_quantities_exposure Exposure

In order to generate an image, a camera effectively integrates irradiance at a patch
on the sensor over time to get exposure, which is converted to an electrical signal.
The default behaviour of many renderers is to ignore this, which as we have seen means
that 1 nit incident on the sensor results in an output signal of 1.0.

1 nit is a tiny amount of light, equivalent by definition to a single candle viewed at a distance. Thus
using physically plausible values for light brightnesses will result in blown out images
unless exposure is taken into account. A full physical camera model would be a good
future addition to OpenUSD, but there is already a means of communicating sensor
exposure via `UsdGeomCamera::GetExposureAttr()` and it is expected that all renderers
implementing UsdLux must respect the value of that attribute by scaling the rendered
image by `pow(2, exposure)`.

\subsection usdLux_Behavior Properties & Behavior

Colors specified in attributes are in energy-linear terms,
and obey the USD convention for indicating their color space via
`colorConfiguration` and `colorSpace` metadata.  See
UsdStage::SetColorConfiguration() for discussion of colorspace
management in USD.

UsdLux presumes a physically-based lighting model where falloff with
distance is a consequence of reduced visible solid angle. Environments
that do not measure the visible solid angle are expected to provide an
approximation, such as inverse-square falloff. Further artistic control
over attenuation can be modelled as light filters.

The behavior of all attributes is in UsdLuxLightAPI is documented on their `Get()`
methods. All attributes are expected to be supported by all light types, with
the effect of each attribute applying multiplicatively in sequence.

The example hdEmbree delegate provides a reference implementation, as well as a
series of unit tests and reference images for renderers to check their own
implementation against.

More complex behaviors are provided via a set of API classes.
These behaviors are common and well-defined but may not be supported
in all rendering environments.  These API classes provide
functions to specify the relevant semantic behavior:

- UsdLuxLightListAPI provides a "light list" relationship to enumerate
locations of known lights in the scene. It can be useful to enumerate
lights without requiring full scene traversal. For example, some
systems require lights to be declared before the rest of the scene.
UsdLuxLightListAPI provides a way to compute this result ahead of time and
store the result in a well-defined place. Pipeline integration of UsdLux
can use this API to discover and publish lights at an appropriate time
-- such as export from any system where lights may be created.

- UsdCollectionAPI provides relationships to represent subsets of geometry
to consider for illumination. These provide hierarchical inclusion and
exclusion -- for example, to illuminate a building but not a window
within. UsdLux supports a concept of fractional illumination, allowing
partial contribution from a light to a particular object, for rendering
systems that support this.

- UsdLuxShadowAPI provides controls to refine shadow behavior in
non-physical ways, including shadow linking, tinting, and falloff.

- UsdLuxShapingAPI provides controls to shape light emission, including focus, 
cone-angle falloff, and IES profiles.

\subsection Extensibility

Like other USD schemas, UsdLux core may be extended to address features
specific to certain environments.  Possible renderer- or
pipeline-specific capabilities that could be addded as extensions include:

- specialized light types
    - point cloud lights
    - volumetric/voxel lights
    - procedural sky models
    - light probes, lightfields
- renderer-specific configuration
    - arbitrary output variable images (AOV's) such as depth or normals
    - light path expressions (LPE's)
    - image post-processing effects
    - refraction and opacity approximations, such as thin shadows
- sampling and optimization tweaks
    - light sample counts
    - importance multipliers
    - integrator path-depth limits
- constraint rigging to attach a light to an object

We provide a utility to aide in extending the UsdLux core schemas, namely the
schema generation script _usdgenschemafromsdr_. This script can be used to 
generate new light schemas from the shader nodes in the SdrRegistry. These light
schemas can be typed schemas that describe a completely new light type or
can be applied API schemas that extend an existing light type automatically by
being specified to \ref Usd_AutoAppliedAPISchemas "auto apply" to an existing
light (such as UsdLuxDiskLight) or light API (such as UsdLuxMeshLightAPI). 

\subsection usdLux_PluginSchemas Plugin Lights and Light Filters

We expect "published, pipeline citizen" render delegates to provide codeless 
schema libraries that contain typed schemas and/or applied API schemas that 
define or extend all of the renderer's core light types. But some render 
delegates may be developed as part of a proprietary application package that is 
only using USD as a mechanism to communicate to that render delegate. In other 
words, the application doesn't really want to participate in the open USD 
ecosystem, but needs to use it for rendering scenes imported from USD and 
augmented using application/renderer-specific lighting features, or finds it 
useful to use USD as an archiving format to send jobs to a render-farm so that 
the full application need not be run there.

In order to lower the barrier somewhat for such applications, we provide 
UsdLuxPluginLight and UsdLuxPluginLightFilter, concrete schema types that
specify a "node identification" encoding just like UsdShadeShader, so that the
application need only plug its extensions into Sdr (by providing node 
definitions that will be consumed by render delegates), and not be required to
take the extra step of generating USD schema definitions. Because they
provide less easily accessible information to users, we do not advocate using 
these types in pipeline-persistent "user-level" USD files.
