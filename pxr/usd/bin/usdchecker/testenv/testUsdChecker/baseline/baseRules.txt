Checking rules: 
------------------------------
[ByteAlignmentChecker]:
 Files within a usdz package must be laid out properly, i.e. they should be aligned to 64 bytes.
------------------------------
[CompressionChecker]:
 Files within a usdz package should not be compressed or encrypted.
------------------------------
[MissingReferenceChecker]:
 The composed USD stage should not contain any unresolvable asset dependencies (in every possible variation of the asset), when using the default asset resolver. 
------------------------------
[StageMetadataChecker]:
 All stages should declare their 'upAxis' and 'metersPerUnit'.  
Stages that can be consumed as referencable assets should furthermore have
a valid 'defaultPrim' declared, and stages meant for consumer-level packaging
should always have upAxis set to 'Y'
------------------------------
[TextureChecker]:
 Texture files should be readable by intended client 
(only .jpg or .png for consumer-level USDZ).
------------------------------
[PrimEncapsulationChecker]:
 Check for basic prim encapsulation rules:
   - Boundables may not be nested under Gprims
   - Connectable prims (e.g. Shader, Material, etc) can only be nested 
     inside other Container-like Connectable prims. Container-like prims
     include Material, NodeGraph, Light, LightFilter, and *exclude Shader*
------------------------------
[NormalMapTextureChecker]:
 UsdUVTexture nodes that feed the _inputs:normals_ of a
UsdPreviewSurface must ensure that the data is encoded and scaled properly.
Specifically:
   - Since normals are expected to be in the range [(-1,-1,-1), (1,1,1)],
     the Texture node must transform 8-bit textures from their [0..1] range by
     setting its _inputs:scale_ to [2, 2, 2, 1] and 
     _inputs:bias_ to [-1, -1, -1, 0]
   - Normal map data is commonly expected to be linearly encoded.  However, many
     image-writing tools automatically set the profile of three-channel, 8-bit
     images to SRGB.  To prevent an unwanted transformation, the UsdUVTexture's
     _inputs:sourceColorSpace_ must be set to "raw".  This program cannot
     currently read the texture metadata itself, so for now we emit warnings
     about this potential infraction for all 8 bit image formats.

------------------------------
Success!
