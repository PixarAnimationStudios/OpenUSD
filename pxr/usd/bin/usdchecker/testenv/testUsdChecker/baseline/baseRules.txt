Checking rules: 
------------------------------
[ByteAlignmentChecker]:
 Files within a usdz package must be laid out properly, i.e. they should be aligned to 64 bytes.
------------------------------
[CompressionChecker]:
 Files within a usdz package should not be compressed or encrypted.
------------------------------
[ShaderPropertyTypeConformanceChecker]:
 Shader prim's input types must be conforming to their appropriate Sdf types in the respective sdr shader.
------------------------------
[MissingReferenceChecker]:
 The composed USD stage should not contain any unresolvable asset dependencies (in every possible variation of the asset), when using the default asset resolver. 
------------------------------
[StageMetadataChecker]:
 All stages should declare their 'upAxis' and 'metersPerUnit'.  
Stages that can be consumed as referencable assets should furthermore have
a valid 'defaultPrim' declared, and stages meant for consumer-level packaging
should always have upAxis set to 'Y'
------------------------------
[TextureChecker]:
 Texture files should be readable by intended client 
(only .jpg, .jpeg or .png for consumer-level USDZ).
------------------------------
[PrimEncapsulationChecker]:
 Check for basic prim encapsulation rules:
   - Boundables may not be nested under Gprims
   - Connectable prims (e.g. Shader, Material, etc) can only be nested 
     inside other Container-like Connectable prims. Container-like prims
     include Material, NodeGraph, Light, LightFilter, and *exclude Shader*
------------------------------
[NormalMapTextureChecker]:
 UsdUVTexture nodes that feed the _inputs:normals_ of a
UsdPreviewSurface must ensure that the data is encoded and scaled properly.
Specifically:
   - Since normals are expected to be in the range [(-1,-1,-1), (1,1,1)],
     the Texture node must transform 8-bit textures from their [0..1] range by
     setting its _inputs:scale_ to (2, 2, 2, 1) and 
     _inputs:bias_ to (-1, -1, -1, 0)
   - Normal map data is commonly expected to be linearly encoded.  However, many
     image-writing tools automatically set the profile of three-channel, 8-bit
     images to SRGB.  To prevent an unwanted transformation, the UsdUVTexture's
     _inputs:sourceColorSpace_ must be set to "raw".

------------------------------
[MaterialBindingAPIAppliedChecker]:
 A prim providing a material binding, must have MaterialBindingAPI applied on the prim.
------------------------------
[SkelBindingAPIAppliedChecker]:
 A prim providing skelBinding properties, must have SkelBindingAPI applied on the prim.
------------------------------
[GeomSubsetsChecker]:
 Validates various aspects of UsdGeomSubsets:
   - GeomSubsets must be authored as direct children of an Imageable prim
   - The set of all subset family names is fetched for each subset parent
     Imageable, and each family is checked for validity
   - If the "materialBind" subset family is authored on an Imageable, it is
     checked to ensure that it is of a restricted type (either "nonOverlapping"
     or "partition"), since it is invalid for an element of geometry to be
     bound to multiple materials.
   - All subsets belonging to the "materialBind" family must be of element type "face",
     since material bindings may only be applied to geometric faces.
   - If a subset has authored material bindings but no authored subset
     family name, it is suggested that the family name should be set to
     "materialBind" to ensure that the material bindings are visible to
     renderers. The material bindings will have no effect otherwise.
