    doc = """The SpatialAudio primitive defines basic properties for encoding 
    playback of an audio file or stream within a USD Stage. The SpatialAudio 
    schema derives from UsdGeomXformable since it can support full spatial 
    audio while also supporting non-spatial mono and stereo sounds. One or 
    more SpatialAudio prims can be placed anywhere in the namespace, though it 
    is advantageous to place truly spatial audio prims under/inside the models 
    from which the sound emanates, so that the audio prim need only be 
    transformed relative to the model, rather than copying its animation.

    \\section Usd_SpatialAudio_TimeScaling Timecode Attributes and Time Scaling
    \\a startTime and \\a endTime are \\ref SdfTimeCode "timecode" valued 
    attributes which gives them the special behavior that 
    \\ref SdfLayerOffset "layer offsets" affecting the layer in 
    which one of these values is authored are applied to the attribute's value 
    itself during value resolution. This allows audio playback to be kept in 
    sync with time sampled animation as the animation is affected by 
    \\ref SdfLayerOffset "layer offsets" in the composition. But this behavior 
    brings with it some interesting edge cases and caveats when it comes to 
    \\ref SdfLayerOffset "layer offsets" that include scale.

    ####  Layer Offsets do not affect Media Dilation
    Although authored layer offsets may have a time scale which can scale the
    duration between an authored \\a startTime and \\a endTime, we make no 
    attempt to infer any playback dilation of the actual audio media itself. 
    Given that \\a startTime and \\a endTime can be independently authored in 
    different layers with differing time scales, it is not possible, in general,
    to define an "original timeframe" from which we can compute a dilation to 
    composed stage-time. Even if we could compute a composed dilation this way,
    it would still be impossible to flatten a stage or layer stack into a single
    layer and still retain the composed audio dilation using this schema.

    #### Inverting startTime and endTime
    Although we do not expect it to be common, it is possible to apply a 
    negative time scale to USD layers, which mostly has the effect of reversing
    animation in the affected composition. If a negative scale is applied to a
    composition that contains authored \\a startTime and \\a endTime, it will
    reverse their relative ordering in time. Therefore, we stipulate when
    \\a playbackMode is "onceFromStartToEnd" or "loopFromStartToEnd", if 
    \\a endTime is less than \\a startTime, then begin playback at \\a endTime, 
    and continue until \\a startTime. When \\a startTime and \\a endTime are 
    inverted, we do not, however, stipulate that playback of the audio media 
    itself be inverted, since doing so "successfully" would require perfect 
    knowledge of when, within the audio clip, relevant audio ends (so that we 
    know how to offset the reversed audio to align it so that we reach the 
    "beginning" at \\a startTime), and sounds played in reverse are not likely 
    to produce desirable results.

    applied and therefore can contain previews; however, to access a stage's 
    "default" previews, one consults 
    the stage's `defaultPrim`.
    
    AssetPreviewsAPI supports the following kinds of previews:
    - **thumbnails** : a set of pre-rendered images of the asset.  There is no 
      prescribed size for thumbnail images, but care should be taken to ensure
      their inclusion does not substantially increase the overall size of an
      asset, as, for example, when packaged into USDZ.
    
    Although the UsdMediaAssetPreviewsAPI class can be used to interrogate any
    prim, no query in the API will succeed unless the schema has been applied
    to the prim.  This schema deals only with asset paths, and clients wishing
    to directly consume the returned data must do so by retrieving an ArAsset
    from the session's ArAssetResolver.
    
    The schema defines no properties or metadata fallback values.  Rather, 
    Asset Previews are encoded as part of a prim's `assetInfo` metadata.  A 
    default thumbnail image would look like:
    ```
1.    assetInfo = {
