/// Instead, "add" will be converted to "append", and "reorder"
/// will be discarded.

///
///
/// One use case for this version of the function is to flatten a layer stack
/// that contains relative asset paths that we want to preserve as relative
/// paths.  For example:
///
/// \code
/// /source/root.usd # sublayers a.usd and b.usd
/// /source/a.usd    # contains reference to ./subdir/layer.usd
/// /source/b.usd
/// /source/subdir/layer.usd
/// \endcode
///
/// We may want to generate \c "/dest/root.flat.usd" knowing that we will
/// (by some other means) also be copying \c "/source/subdir" into \c
/// "/dest/subdir".  It's useful then to preserve the relative paths.
///
/// Note, only the caller knows the ultimate destination of the flattened layer.
/// So to accomplish this, we can provide a \c resolveAssetPathFn callback that
/// captures the outputDir, tests if the authored path is relative, and if so,
/// computes a new relative path (based on where it will eventually be
/// exported).
