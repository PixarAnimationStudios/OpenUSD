              A value of 0 produces an intensity of 1, -1 produces .5. You may wonder why you
              might use Exposure, and the answer is that real world lighting has high energies
              and typical exposures are low values while you may have to type a really large
              number for equivalent Intensity. This is also comfortable to artists familiar with
