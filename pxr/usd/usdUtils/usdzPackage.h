class SdfAssetPath;

/// Creates a USDZ package containing the specified asset, identified by its 
/// \p assetPath. The created package will include a localized version of the 
/// asset itself and all of its external dependencies. Any anonymous layers that
/// are encountered during dependency discovery will be serialized into the
/// resulting package. Due to localization, the packaged layers might be 
/// modified to have different asset paths.
///
/// You can optionally specify a different package-internal name for the first
/// layer of the asset by specifying \p firstLayerName. By default,
/// \p firstLayerName is empty, meaning that the original name is preserved.
///
/// The \p editLayersInPlace parameter controls the strategy used for managing 
/// changes to layers (including the root layer and all transitive layer 
/// dependencies) that occur during the package creation process.  When 
/// \p editLayersInPlace is false, a temporary, anonymous copy of each 
/// modified layer is created and written into the package. This has the 
/// advantage of leaving source layers untouched at the expense of creating a 
/// copy of each modified layer in memory for the duration of this function.
///
/// When \p editLayersInPlace is set to true, layers are modified in-place and 
/// not reverted or persisted once the package has been created. In this case, 
/// there is no overhead of creating copies of each modified layer.  If you have
/// UsdStages open during the function call that reference the layers being 
/// modified, you may receive warnings or composition errors.  While these 
/// errors will not affect the resulting package adversely, it is strongly 
/// recommended that this function is run in isolation after any source 
/// UsdStages have been closed.
/// 
/// Returns true if the package was created successfully.
/// 
/// \note Clients of this function must take care of configuring the asset 
/// resolver context before invoking the function. To create a default 
/// resolver context, use \ref CreateDefaultContextForAsset() with the 
/// asset path.
/// 
/// \note If the given asset has a dependency on a directory (i.e. an external 
/// reference to a directory path), the dependency is ignored and the contents 
/// of the directory are not included in the created package.
