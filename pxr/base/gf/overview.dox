\section gf_overview Overview

Contains foundation classes and functions for working with the basic mathematical aspects of graphics.  

The high-level grouping of the classes and functions is as follows:

<ul>
 	<li> \link group_gf_LinearAlgebra \b Linear \b Algebra - \endlink Includes classes representing basic types, including vectors of varying numbers and types (such as vectors of two, three, and four float components), two and three-dimensional arrays of sizes, and compound linear transformations. </li>
 	<li>  \link group_gf_BasicMath \b Basic \b Mathematical \b Operations - \endlink  Includes classes and functions for performing operations such as converting between radians and degrees, calculating square roots, minimum and maximum values, absolute values, and so on.</li>
	<li> \link group_gf_BasicGeometry \b Basic \b Geometry - \endlink  
Includes classes that represent basic types such as one to three-dimensional 
floating point ranges, three-dimensional bounding boxes, planes, rays, frusta, 
and a camera model.</li>
	<li> \link group_gf_DebuggingOutput \b Output \b For \b Debugging - \endlink  Includes functions for quickly outputting Gf types (these are particularly useful for diagnostic purposes).</li>
<!--  	<li> \link group_gf_Color Color \endlink</li>
  	<li> \link group_gf_Gamma Gamma Mapping</li> \endlink -->
</ul>
