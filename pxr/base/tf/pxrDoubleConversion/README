1. Copy the new double conversion files into pxrDoubleConversion.

    patch -d [path to pxrDoubleConversion folder] < [path to pxr-double-conversion.patch]
    ```
    
How to update the patchfile
--------------------------------
After manually making any necessary edits/updates to  
files in pxrDoubleConversion, download the original 
double-conversion folder and run the following 
command to generate a new patch file:

```bash
diff -ruaN -x README 
           -x CMakeLists.txt
           -x SConscript
           -x .gitignore
           -x pxr-double-conversion.patch
           [path to double-conversion folder]
        [path to pxrDoubleConversion folder]
> [path to pxr-double-conversion.patch]
```
