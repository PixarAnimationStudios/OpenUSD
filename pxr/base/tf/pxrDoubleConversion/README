Instructions for bringing in a new version of double-conversion
---------------------------------------------------------------

Version: 2.0.0
Source can be found at:  https://github.com/google/double-conversion

1. Copy the new double conversion files into pxrDoubleConversion.

2. Apply the patch file. This will add our namespaces.
    ```bash
    patch -p0 < pxr-double-conversion.patch
    ```
    
How to update the patchfile
--------------------------------
If you need to manually make some edits, and thus need to 
generate a new patch file, run the following command.

```bash
diff -ruaN -x README 
           -x CMakeLists.txt
           -x SConscript
           -x pxr-double-conversion.patch
           double-conversion/ 
           .
> pxr-double-conversion.patch
```
