/// \class TfSpinRWMutex
///
/// This class implements a readers-writer spin lock that emphasizes throughput
/// when there is light contention or moderate contention dominated by readers.
/// Like all spin locks, significant contention performs poorly; consider a
/// different algorithm design or synchronization strategy in that case.
///
/// In the best case, acquiring a read lock is an atomic add followed by a
/// conditional branch, and acquiring a write lock is an atomic bitwise-or
/// followed by a conditional branch.
///
/// When contended by only readers, acquiring a read lock is the same: an atomic
/// add followed by a conditional branch.  Of course the shared cache line being
/// concurrently read and modified will affect performance.
///
/// In the worst case, acquiring a read lock does the atomic add and conditional
/// branch, but the condition shows writer activity, so the add must be undone
/// by a subtraction, and then the thread must wait to see no writer activity
/// before trying again.
///
/// Similarly in the worst case for acquiring a write lock, the thread does the
/// atomic bitwise-or, but sees another active writer, and then must wait to see
/// no writer activity before trying again.  Once the exclusive-or is done
/// successfully, then the writer must wait for any pending readers to clear out
/// before it can proceed.
///
/// This class provides a nested TfSpinRWMutex::ScopedLock that makes it easy to
/// acquire locks, upgrade reader to writer, downgrade writer to reader, and
/// have those locks automatically release when the ScopedLock is destroyed.
