# Python 3 buffers output by default. We monkey-patch the print function here
# so that stdout is flushed after each print statement, thus producing the
# correct output. This doesn't work in python 2, even with the print function
# from __future__ because that version of the print function does not have a
# flush keyword parameter.
#
# On Windows with python 2 if this script is run with stdout redirected then
# the C++ stdout buffer is different from Python's stdout buffer.  As a result
# output from Python stdout and C++ stdout will not interleave as expected
# unless we flush both after each write.  We force flushing in Python here.
