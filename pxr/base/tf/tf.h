/// (and consider using a \c vector<> in place of a built-in array).
/// Also, note that you need to put parenthesis after \c TfDeleter
/// in the call to \c for_each().
///
/// Finally, \c TfDeleter also works for map-like collections.
/// Note that this works as follows: if \c TfDeleter is handed
/// a datatype of type \c std::pair<T1,T2*>, then the second element
/// of the pair is deleted, but the first (whether or not it is a pointer)
/// is left alone.  In other words, if you give \c TfDeleter() a pair of
/// pointers, it only deletes the second, but never the first.  This is the
/// desired behavior for maps.

/*
 * The compile-time constants are not part of doxygen; if you know they're here,
 * fine, but they should be used rarely, so we don't go out of our way to
 * advertise them.
 *
 * Here's the idea: you may have an axiom or conditional check which is just too
 * expensive to make part of a release build. Compilers these days will optimize
 * away expressions they can evaluate at compile-time.  So you can do
 *
 *     if (TF_DEV_BUILD)
 *         TF_AXIOM(expensiveConditional);
 *
 * to get a condition axiom.  You can even write
 *
 *     TF_AXIOM(!TF_DEV_BUILD || expensiveConditional);
 *
 * What you CANNOT do is write
 *      #if defined(TF_DEV_BUILD)
 * or
 *      #if TF_DEV_BUILD == 0
 *
 * The former compiles but always yields true; the latter doesn't compile.
 * In other words, you can change the flow of control using these constructs,
 * but we deliberately are prohibiting things like
 *
 * struct Bar {
 * #if ...
 *     int _onlyNeededForChecks;
 * #endif
 * };
 *
 * or creating functions which only show up in some builds.
