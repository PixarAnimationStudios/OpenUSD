/// \class TfBigRWMutex
///
/// This class implements a readers-writer mutex and provides a scoped lock
/// utility.  Multiple clients may acquire a read lock simultaneously, but only
/// one client may hold a write lock, exclusive to all other locks.
///
/// This class emphasizes throughput for (and is thus best used in) the case
/// where there are many simultaneous reader clients all concurrently taking
/// read locks, with clients almost never taking write locks.  As such, taking a
/// read lock is a lightweight operation that usually does not imply much
/// hardware-level concurrency penalty (i.e. writes to shared cache lines).
/// This is done by allocating several cache-line-sized chunks of memory to
/// represent lock state, and readers typically only deal with a single lock
/// state (and therefore a single cache line).  On the other hand, taking a
/// write lock is very expensive from a hardware concurrency point of view; it
/// requires atomic memory operations on every cache-line.
///
/// To achieve good throughput under highly read-contended workloads, this class
/// allocates 10s of cachelines worth of state (~1 KB) to help minimize
/// hardware-level contention.  So it is probably not appropriate to use as
/// (e.g.) a member variable in an object that there are likely to be many of.
///
/// This class has been measured to show >10x throughput compared to
/// tbb::spin_rw_mutex, and >100x better throughput compared to
/// tbb::queuing_rw_mutex on reader-contention-heavy loads.  The tradeoff being
/// the relatively large size required compared to these other classes.
