/// A \c TfStopwatch can be used to perform very precise timings at runtime,
/// even in very tight loops.  The cost of "starting" or "stopping" a
/// \c TfStopwatch is very small: approximately 40 nanoseconds on a 900 Mhz
/// Pentium III Linux box, 300 nanoseconds on a 400 Mhz Sun, and 200
/// nanoseconds on a 250 Mhz SGI.
///
/// Note that this class is not thread-safe: if you need to take timings in a
/// multi-threaded region of a process, let each thread have its own
/// \c TfStopwatch and then combine results using the \c AddFrom() member
/// function.
