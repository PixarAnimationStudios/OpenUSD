/// \ingroup group_gf_BasicGeometry
///
/// Basic type: View frustum.
///
/// This class represents a viewing frustum in three dimensional eye space. It
/// may represent either a parallel (orthographic) or perspective projection.
/// One can think of the frustum as being defined by 6 boundary planes.
///
/// The frustum is specified using these parameters:
///  \li The \em position of the viewpoint.
///  \li The \em rotation applied to the default view frame, which is
///      looking along the -z axis with the +y axis as the "up"
///      direction.
///  \li The 2D \em window on the reference plane that defines the left,
///      right, top, and bottom planes of the viewing frustum, as
///      described below.
///  \li The distances to the \em near and \em far planes.
///  \li The \em projection \em type
///  \li The view distance.
///
/// The window and near/far parameters combine to define the view frustum as
/// follows. Transform the -z axis and the +y axis by the frustum rotation to
/// get the world-space \em view \em direction and \em up \em direction. Now
/// consider the \em reference \em plane that is perpendicular to the view
/// direction, a distance of referencePlaneDepth from the viewpoint, and whose
/// y axis corresponds to the up direction.  The window rectangle is specified
/// in a 2D coordinate system embedded in this plane. The origin of the
/// coordinate system is the point at which the view direction vector
/// intersects the plane. Therefore, the point (0,1) in this plane is found by
/// moving 1 unit along the up direction vector in this plane. The vector from
/// the viewpoint to the resulting point will form a 45-degree angle with the
/// view direction.
///
/// The view distance is only useful for interactive applications. It can be
/// used to compute a look at point which is useful when rotating around an
/// object of interest.
