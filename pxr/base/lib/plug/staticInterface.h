/// \class PlugStaticInterface
///
/// Provides access to an interface into a plugin.
///
/// A plugin can provide one or more interface types through which clients
/// can access the plugin's full functionality without needing to link
/// against the plugin (if you had to link against it, it wouldn't be a
/// plugin).  This is a convenience;  you can achieve the same effect
/// with TfType::GetFactory().
///
/// Typical usage is:
/// \code
/// #include "ExtShipped/Core/SomePlugin.h"
/// #include "pxr/base/plug/staticInterface.h"
///
/// static PlugStaticInterface<SomePluginInterface> ptr;
///
/// void MyFunction() {
///     if (ptr) {
///         // Plugin is available.
///         ptr->MakePluginDoSomething();
///     }
///     else {
///         // Plugin is not available.  (An error will have been reported
///         // the first time through.)
///     }
/// }
/// \endcode
///
/// The interface must be defined correctly.  In particular, it must have no
/// data members (static or otherwise), no static member functions, no
/// non-virtual member functions, only pure virtual member functions, no
/// constructors except an inline protected default that does nothing (or no
/// constructors at all), and a virtual destructor as the first member that
/// \e must be defined inline with an empty body.  The last requirement is
/// so that clients of the interface that include the header get a typeinfo
/// for the interface.  Note that due to limitations in the GCC C++ ABI an
/// inline virtual destructor prevents dynamic_cast<> and typeid() from
/// working correctly;  do not use those on the interface type.
///
/// For example:
/// 
/// \code
/// class SomePluginInterface {
/// public:
///     virtual ~SomePluginInterface() { }
///
///     virtual bool MakePluginDoSomething() const = 0;
///
/// protected:
///     SomePluginInterface() { }
/// };
/// \endcode
/// Note that interface types do not share a common base class.
///
/// For the plugin to work, there must be a concrete implementation of the
/// interface type, the interface type must be in plugInfo file, and the
/// interface type must be registered with TfType using
/// \c PLUG_REGISTER_INTERFACE_SINGLETON_TYPE:
/// \code
/// #include "ExtShipped/Core/SomePlugin.h"
/// #include "pxr/base/plug/interfaceFactory.h"
/// #include <iostream>
/// class SomePluginImplementation : public SomePluginInterface {
/// public:
///     virtual bool MakePluginDoSomething() const {
///         return std::cout << "Plugin did something" << std::endl;
///     }
/// };
/// PLUG_REGISTER_INTERFACE_SINGLETON_TYPE(SomePluginInterface,
///                                        SomePluginImplementation)
/// \endcode
/// This causes TfType::Find<SomePluginInterface>::Manufacture() to return
/// a pointer to a singleton instance of SomePluginImplementation.
///
/// Note that only SomePluginInterface needs to be registered in the plugInfo
/// file and with TfType; other types provided by the plugin need only be
/// defined in SomePlugin.h.  In addition, SomePluginInterface can provide
/// access to free functions in SomePlugin; clients would otherwise have to use
/// \c dlsym() to access free functions in the plugin.
///
/// Warning: the \c PlugStaticInterface construct relies upon zero-initialization
/// of global data: therefore, you can only use this structure for static data
/// member of classes, variables declared at file-scope, or variables declared
/// static within a function.  Do \e not declare a \c PlugStaticInterface object
/// as a local variable, as a member of a class or structure, or as a function
/// parameter.
