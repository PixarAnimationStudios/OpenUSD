///
/// A class that wraps a file output stream, providing improved tolerance for
/// write failures. The wrapper opens an output file stream to a temporary
/// file on the same file system as the desired destination file, and if no
/// errors occur while writing the temporary file, it can be renamed
/// atomically to the destination file name. In this way, write failures are
/// encountered while writing the temporary file content, rather than while
/// writing the destination file. This ensures that, if the destination
/// existed prior to writing, it is left untouched in the event of a write
/// failure, and if the destination did not exist, a partial file is not
/// written.
///
