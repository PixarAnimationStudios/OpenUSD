/// Fast pool based allocator.
///
/// A \c TfPoolAllocator is a very fast allocator for requests for a single
/// size.  It has the advantage that it does not waste any space, as \c
/// malloc() does, storing the size of each memory request for reclamation
/// purposes.  Additionally, the allocation and deallocation routines are
/// inlined, and extremely short.
///
/// To use, one constructs an allocator which specifies the size of each
/// element and the total number of bytes to allocate per chunk.  The bytes
/// per chunk should be a multiple of the element size although this is
/// neither checked nor enforced.
///
/// \par Thread-Safety This class is thread safe.  One can disable thread
/// safety via a call to \c SetThreadSafety().  This is useful when the client
/// will absolutely be running in a single thread and wishes to not pay the
/// price of the locking behavior.
