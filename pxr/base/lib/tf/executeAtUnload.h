/// It is sometimes important for dynamically loaded modules (i.e. plugins) to
/// execute "clean up" code upon unload.  This macro allows one to specify
/// code to be executed each time a dynamically loaded module is unloaded.  In
/// particular, if the module is reloaded and then again unloaded, the
/// clean-up code is again run.
///
/// Note that "unload time" differs from "exit time".  The clean-up code is
/// not run when the program exits, because modules are not unloaded on exit.
///
/// Finally, this facility assumes that the dynamically loaded module was
/// unloaded by a call to \c TfDlclose(), rather than directly by a call to \c
/// dlclose().
///
/// Here is an example of use:
///
/// \code
/// #include "pxr/base/tf/executeAtUnload.h"
/// #include "pxr/base/tf/instantiateSingleton.h"
///
/// class FileCache {
///     ...
/// };
/// TF_INSTANTIATE_SINGLETON(FileCache);
///
/// TF_EXECUTE_AT_UNLOAD()
/// {
///     TfSingleton<FileCache>::DeleteInstance();
/// }
/// \endcode
///
/// If a singleton intance of \c FileCache was ever created, then at module
/// unload time, it will be destroyed.
///
/// The \c TF_EXECUTE_AT_UNLOAD() macro can be used once per .cpp file.
/// Attempts to use this macro twice in the same .cpp file result in a compile
/// error.  Do \e NOT use this macro in a header file.
///
/// \c TF_EXECUTE_AT_UNLOAD() is meant to look like a function definition,
/// except that no return type is specified.  Any code that is legal to put in
/// a function can occur in the body (i.e. between the braces).
