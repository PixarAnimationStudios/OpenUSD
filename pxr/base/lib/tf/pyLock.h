/// \class TfPyLock
///
/// Convenience class for accessing the Python Global Interpreter Lock.
///
/// The Python API is not thread-safe.  Accessing the Python API from outside
/// the context of Python execution requires extra care when multiple threads
/// may be present.  There are various schemes for how this should be done,
/// and the conventions have been changing with Python versions through 2.X.
///
/// This class provides a convenient and centralized location for managing the
/// Python Global Interpreter Lock and related Python Thread State.
///
/// The easiest way to use this class is to simply create a local variable in
/// any function that will access the Python API. Upon construction, this will
/// acquire the Python lock and establish the correct thread state for the
/// caller.  Upon exit from the current scope, when the instance is destroyed,
/// the thread state will be restored and the lock will be released.
///
/// \code
/// void MyFunc()
/// {
///     TfPyLock dummy;
///     ...(access Python API)...
/// }
/// \endcode
///
/// If you need to temporarily release the lock during execution, (to perform
/// blocking I/O for example), you can call Release() explicitly, then call
/// Acquire() again to reclaim the lock.
///
/// \code
/// void MyFunc()
/// {
///     TfPyLock pyLock;
///     ...(access Python API)...
///     pyLock.Release();  // let other threads run while we're blocked
///     ...(some blocking I/O or long running operation)...
///     pyLock.Acquire();
///     ...(more access to Python API)...
/// }
/// \endcode
///
/// Note that it IS EXPLICITLY OK to recursively create instances of this
/// class, and thus recursively acquire the GIL and thread state. It is NOT OK
/// to recursively attempt to Acquire() the same instance, that will have no
/// effect and will generate a diagnostic warning.
///
/// This class also provides an exception-safe way to release the GIL
/// temporarily for blocking calls, like Py_BEGIN/END_ALLOW_THREADS in the
/// Python C API.
///
/// \code
/// void MyFunc()
/// {
///     TfPyLock lock;
///     ...(access Python API)...
///     lock.BeginAllowThreads(); // totally unlock the GIL temporarily.
///     ...(some blocking I/O or long running operation)...
///     lock.EndAllowThreads();
///     ...(more access to Python API)...
/// }
/// \endcode
///
/// This looks similar to the above example using \a Release(), but it is
/// different.  The Python lock is recursive, so the call to \a Release() is
/// not guaranteed to actually release the lock, it just releases the deepest
/// lock. In contrast \a BeginAllowThreads() will fully unlock the GIL so that
/// other threads can run temporarily regardless of how many times the lock is
/// recursively taken.
///
/// The valid states and transitions for this class are as follows.
///
/// State           Valid Transitions
/// --------------------------------------------------------------
/// Released        Acquire() -> Acquired
/// Acquired        Release() -> Released, BeginAllowThreads() -> AllowsThreads
/// AllowsThreads   EndAllowThreads() -> Acquired
///
/// Note that upon construction the class is in the Acquired state.  Upon
/// destruction, the class will move to the Released state.
///
/// \warning Instances of this class should only be used as automatic (stack)
/// variables, or in thread local storage. DO NOT create a single instance
/// that could be shared across multiple threads.
