/// The current time is returned as a number of "ticks", where each tick
/// represents some system-dependent amount of time.  The resolution of the
/// timing routines varies, but on all systems, it is well under one
/// microsecond.  The cost of this routine is approximately 40 nanoseconds on
/// a 900 Mhz Pentium III Linux box, 300 nanoseconds on a 400 Mhz Sun, and 200
/// nanoseconds on a 250 Mhz SGI, and 200 nanoseconds on a 500 MHz PowerMac
/// G4.
///
/// On SGIs and Linux x86 and Apple PPC systems, the time is queried by
/// reading from a hardware register, which is very fast; on the SUNS, a
/// standard system call (gethrtime()) is used, which accounts for the
/// slowness of the operation.
///
/// By contrast, the standard system call \c gettimeofday() takes,
/// respectively, 540, 4900 nanoseconds, and 370 nanoseconds on the same
/// Linux, SGI and SUN workstations.
