\section js_overview Overview

Methods for parsing and writing JSON data from C++, and converting between
arbitrary recursive container structures.

This library provides an abstraction of values described by the JSON standard.
It abstracts away the details of how the parsing and serialization are
performed, in order to allow the implementation to change without affecting
clients. It also adheres to the coding standards of this repository, providing
a more consistent interface for developers.

The top-level entrypoints are in \ref js/json.h

No Python bindings are provided by this library. Use the Python standard
library 'json' module when working with json data in Python.
