    '''This class's primary responsibility is delivering key events to
    "the right place".  Given usdview's simplistic approach to shortcuts
    (i.e. just uses the native Qt mechanism that does not allow for 
    context-sensitive keypress dispatching), we take a simplistic approach
    to routing: use Qt's preferred mechanism of processing keyPresses 
    only in widgets that have focus; therefore, the primary behavior of this
    filter is to track mouse-position in order to set widget focus, so that
    widgets with keyboard navigation behaviors operate when the mouse is over
    them.
    
    We add one special behaviors on top of that, which is to turn unaccepted
    left/right events into up/down events for TreeView widgets, because we
    do not have a specialized class on which to provide this nice navigation
    behavior.'''
