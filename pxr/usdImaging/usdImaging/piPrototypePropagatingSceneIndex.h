///
/// A scene index translating USD point instancers into Hydra instancers.
///
/// It applies various USD semantics and populates the "instancedBy" schema,
/// including the prototypeRoot data source which is needed by the USD native
/// instancing scene index.
///
/// To achieve various USD behaviors, it has a (recursive) instancer observer
/// that inserts copies of prototypes processed through the prototype scene
/// index into appropriate places in namespace.
