/// Selection highlighting in Hydra:
///
/// Hydra Storm (*) supports selection highlighting of:
/// (a) a set of rprims, wherein each rprim is entirely highlighted
/// (b) a set of instances of an rprim, wherein each instance is highlighted
/// (c) a set of subprimitives of an rprim, wherein each subprim is highlighted.
/// Subprimitives support is limited to elements (faces of meshes, or
/// individual curves of basis curves), edges of meshes/curves,
///  and points of meshes.
/// 
/// * While the goal is have an architecture that is extensible by rendering
/// backends, the current implementation is heavily influenced by the Storm
/// backend.
/// 
/// Background:
/// The current selection implementation is, in a sense, global in nature. 
/// If there are no selected objects, we do not bind any selection-related 
/// resources, nor does the shader execute any selection-related operations.
/// 
/// If there are one or more selected objects, we *don't* choose to have them
/// in a separate 'selection' collection.
/// Instead, we stick by AZDO principles and avoid command buffer changes as
/// a result of selection updates (which would involve removal of draw items
/// corresponding to the selected objects from each render pass' command buffer
/// and building the selection pass' command buffer).
/// We build an integer buffer encoding of the selected items, for use in the
/// fragment shader, that allows us to perform a small number of lookups to
/// quickly tell us if a fragment needs to be highlighted.
///
/// For scene indices, the HdxSelectionTracker uses the HdSelectionsSchema
/// (instaniated with GetFromParent of a prim data source) for a prim to
/// determine the prim's selection status. However, to support scene delegates,
/// we do support settings the selection directly with SetSelection.
/// If both are used, the union of the selections is taken.
///
/// Conceptually, the implementation is split into:
/// (a) HdSelection (for clients using scene delegates) : Client facing API
/// that builds a collection of selected items. This is agnostic of the
/// rendering backend.
/// HdSelectionsSchema (for clients using scene indices) : Scene indices
/// can populate this schema for each selected prim.
/// (b) HdxSelectionTracker: Base class that observes (a) and encodes it as
/// needed by (c). This may be specialized to be backend specific.
/// (c) HdxSelectionTask : A scene task that, currently, only syncs resources
/// related to selection highlighting. Currently, this is tied to Storm.
/// (d) HdxRenderSetupTask : A scene task that sets up the render pass shader
/// to use the selection highlighting mixin in the render pass(es) of
/// HdxRenderTask. This is relevant only to Storm.
