/// \class HdRenderThread
///
/// HdRenderThread is a utility that specific render delegates can choose to
/// use depending on their needs.  It provides a system for rendering in a
/// background thread, and synchronizing between hydra (either in the main
/// thread, or the sync threadpool) and the rendering thread.
///
/// \section HdRenderThread_StateMachine State Machine
///
/// The render thread is implemented in terms of a state machine, and hydra
/// requests to the render thread are implemented in terms of transitions on
/// that state machine.
///
/// States:
/// - \em StateInitial - indicates the render thread hasn't been started.
/// - \em StateIdle - indicates the render thread is running, but not rendering.
/// - \em StateRendering - indicates the render thread is rendering.
/// - \em StateTerminated - indicates the render thread is shutting down.
///
/// Transitions:
/// - StartThread():  StateInitial => StateIdle
/// - StartRender():  StateIdle, StateRendering => StateRendering
/// - StopRender():   StateIdle, StateRendering => StateIdle
/// - StopThread():   StateIdle, StateRendering => StateTerminated
/// - StopThread():   StateTerminated => StateInitial
///

/// Having a locked and shared framebuffer is important if you want to avoid

/// Stopping the render only when you're about to make a scene edit means that
/// long-running renders aren't interrupted if the scene is static. Hiding the
/// renderer's scene data handle behind AcquireSceneForEdit helps callers
/// use the synchronization mechanisms correctly.
///
/// The render is restarted at the last possible second, in the render pass,
/// after we know scene edits are done.
///
/// The render callback should use IsStopRequested() as a cancellation
/// mechanism.
