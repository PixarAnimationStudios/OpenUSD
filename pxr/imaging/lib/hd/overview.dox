libHd is a scenegraph agnostic, render engine designed for high
performance playback.

Hd provides a uniform drawing framework that can combine multiple scenegraph
inputs into a single, sorted render pass and can share and aggregate underlying
GPU resources, such as mesh refinements or topological data. It is optimized 
both for dynamically changing scenes and cached playback.

\section hd_datastructures Primary Data Structures

There are three primary sub-systems: scenegraph index, the drawing/compute
framework and the resource manager. The dependencies of these systems are
structured strictly in that order, the scenegraph can depend on the drawing
framework and the drawing framework can depend on the resource manager.

In addition to these three primary subsystems, there is a user-facing API to 
execute drawing commands. This includes, for example, HdEngine and
HdRenderPass. For simplicity, these are included in the "drawing framework"
diagram below, but actually have cross-cutting dependencies.

Finally, there are utilities for monitoring performance and debugging. The 
full dependency stack looks as follows:

\b The \b Drawing \b Framework 

Drawing is done by gathering all draw items for a RenderPass and constructing a
CommandBuffer. The Engine structured such that it cannot know what RenderIndex
is providing DrawItems; this is critical to allow multiple data RenderIndex
sources to contribute to a single render pass (imagine Usd rendering in
Presto).

<pre>
HdEngine: Entry point for drawing, consumes HdRenderPass, produces HdCommandBuffer.

HdRenderPass
  |
  |--- HdRprimCollection: Indicates selected rprims for render pass
  |--- HdRenderIndex: Usd, Presto, ...
  |--- HdCommandBuffer

HdRenderPassState
  |
  |--- Camera states (view and projection matrices, viewport)
  |--- Rasterization states (alpha, depth, tessellation level, etc)

HdCommandBuffer: The work to be performed for a single render pass
  |
  |--- HdDrawItem[]: A view of DrawItems sorted by GPU state, including alpha sort
  |--- Hd_DrawBatch[]: A GPU representation of the DrawItems
  
HdDrawItem: Abstraction of an OpenGL draw call.
  |
  |--- HdDrawingCoord
  |--- Hd_GeometricShader
  |--- HdRprimSharedData

</pre>

\b The \b Compute \b Framework 

Hd supports computation of primvar data scheduled through HdResourceRegistry.
HdComputation instances added to a registry can generate primvar data directly
into the GPU buffers of associated rprims for drawing purposes. Support for
externally defined primvar computation kernels is provided by HdExtComputation.

<pre>
HdComputation: Interface for GPU computation into an HdBufferArrayRange.

HdExtComputation: Interface for user or asset defined computations.
  |
  |--- HdExtCompCpuComputation: Runs CPU compute kernels, outputs into HdBufferSources
  |
  |--- HdExtCompGpuComputation: Runs GPU compute kernels, outputs into HdBufferArrayRange

</pre>

\b The \b Scenegraph \b Index

The scenegraph index is a mapping from the source scenegraph's prim to a prim
in the render engine, an Rprim. The scenegraph is responsible for providing any
inherited graphics state required for drawing, so the engine prim structure can
remain flat for efficiency. As a result, only prims that can result in draw
calls exist in the RenderIndex, such as meshes and curves.

The diagram below depicts object ownership; StripedBufferArray, Topology, and 
BufferResource are shared objects.

<pre>
HdSceneDelegate: Abstracts the client scene graph (Usd, Presto, ...)
  |
  |--- HdRenderIndex: Holds the prim mapping from client to render engine
         |
         |--- HdRprim: Subdiv, Curve, ...
                |
                |--- HdRepr: Hull, Refined, BBox, Edges, Points
                |      |
                |      |--- HdDrawItem: A single GL draw call
                |             |
                |             |--- HdRprimSharedData: Shader, ...
                |             |
                |             |--- HdDrawingCoord: a bundle of buffer array ranges
                |                    |
                |                    |--- HdBufferArrayRange: A subset of aggregated buffer HdBufferArray
                |
                |--- HdMeshTopology
                       |
                       |--- PxOsdMeshTopology (face vertices, indices)
                       |
                       |--- Subdivision data

</pre>

\b The \b Resource \b Manager
The resource management subsystem is responsible for resource allocation, buffer aggregation, and resource sharing.

<pre>

HdResourceRegistry
  |
  |--- Constant (per-rprim) Buffers -> HdBufferResource[] (HdInterleavedMemoryManager)
  |
  |--- Instance Buffers             -> HdBufferResource[] (HdVBOMemoryManager)
  |
  |--- Vertex Primvar Buffers       -> HdBufferResource[] (HdVBOMemoryManager)
  |    Element Primvar Buffefs
  |    FaceVarying Primvar Buffers
  |
  |--- Topology Buffers             -> HdBufferResource[] (HdVBOMemoryManager)
  |
  |--- Shader Parameters            -> HdBufferResource[] (HdInterleavedMemoryManager)
  |
  |--- Compute Buffers              -> HdBufferResource[] (HdInterleavedSSBOMemoryManager)
  |
  |--- Uniform Buffers              -> HdBufferResource[] (HdInterleavedUBOMemoryManager)
  |
  |--- Textures

</pre>

\b Supported OpenGL versions

Hydra requires at least OpenGL 4.0.
When higher GL versions, or certain extensions, are available, the following performance optimizations are automatically enabled.

<table>

    <tr><td>Bindless Buffer      </td><td>NV_shader_buffer_load</td></tr>
