/// \class HdDirtyList
///
/// Used for faster iteration of dirty rprims, filtered by mask.
///
/// GetDirtyRprims/GetSize implicitly refresh and cache the list if needed.
/// The returning prims list will be used for sync.
///
/// DirtyList construction is tend to be expensive. We have 3 layer
/// versioning to make it efficient.
///
/// 1. Nothing changed on rprims since last time (super fast)
///   when orbiting a camera around, no prims need to be synced.
///   DirtyList returns empty vector GetDirtyRprims.
///   This can be detected by HdChangeTracker::GetChangeCount. It's incremented
///   when any change made on any prim.
///
/// 2. Constantly updating Prims in a stable set (fast)
///   when munging or playing back, the same set of prims are being updated,
///   while the remaining prims (could be huge -- entire cityset) are static.
///   Those animating prims can be distinguished by the Varying bit. The Varying
///   bit is set on a prim when any dirty bit is set, and stays even after clean
///   the dirty bit until HdChangeTracker::ResetVaryingState clears out.
///
///   DirtyList caches those prims in a list at the first time (described in 3.),
///   and returns the list for the subsequent queries. Since that list is
///   conservatively picked by the Varying bit instead of the actual DirtyBits
///   needed for various reprs, consumer of DirtyList needs to check the
///   dirtybits again (this is a common pattern in HdRprim, HdMesh and other).
///
/// 3. Varying state changed (medium cost)
///   when a exisitng prim newly starts updating (start munging), or when
///   a majority of the dirtylist stop updating, we need to reconstruct
///   the dirtylist. HdChangeTracker::GetVaryingStateVersion() tells the
///   right timing to refresh, by comparing the cached version number in
///   the dirtylist.
///
///   To construct a dirtylist, the Varying bit is checked instead of other
///   dirtybits, since effective dirtybits may differ over prims, by prim
///   type (mesh vs curve) or by per-prim repr style (flat vs smooth)
///
///   example: [x]=Varying   [x*]=Dirty,Varying
///
///    say in change tracker:
///       A B C D E [F*] [G] [H*] [I*] [J] [K] L M N ...
///    and a collection has:
///               E  F  G  H
///    then the dirtylist will be:
///                  F*, G, H*
///
///    Note that G is not dirty, but it exists in the dirtylist.
///    This optimization gives the maximum efficiency when all of Varying
///    prims are being updated.
///
/// 4. Initial creation, collection changes (most expensive)
///   If we fail to early out all the above condition, such as when we add
///   new prims or switch to new repr, all prims in a collection should be
///   passed down to HdRenderIndex::Sync, except ones we know that are
///   completely clean. Although it requires to sweep all prims in a collection,
///   this traversal has already been optimized to some extent in
///   _FilterByRootPaths and we can still leverage that code.
