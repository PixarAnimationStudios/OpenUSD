/// \class HdStExtCompGpuComputation
/// A Computation that represents a GPU implementation of a ExtComputation.
///
/// The computation implements the basic:
///    input HdBufferArrayRange -> processing -> output HdBufferArrayRange
/// model of HdComputations where processing happens in Execute during the
/// Execute phase of HdResourceRegistry::Commit.
///
/// The computation is performed in three stages by three companion classes:
/// 
/// 1. HdStExtCompGpuComputationBufferSource is responsible for loading
/// input HdBuffersources into the input HdBufferArrayRange during the Resolve
/// phase of the HdResourceRegistry::Commit processing.
///
/// 2. HdStExtCompGpuComputationResource holds the committed GPU resident
/// resources along with the compiled compute shading kernel to execute.
/// The values of the HdBufferArrayRanges for the inputs are stored in this
/// object. The resource can store heterogenous sources with differing number
/// of elements as may be required by computations.
///
/// 3. HdStExtCompGpuComputation executes the kernel using the committed GPU
/// resident resources and stores the results to the destination
/// HdBufferArrayRange given in Execute. The destination HdBufferArrayRange is
/// allocated by the owning HdRprim that registers the computation with the
/// HdResourceRegistry by calling HdResourceRegistry::AddComputation.
