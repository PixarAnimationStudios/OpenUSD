/// \class HdSt_BasisCurvesShaderKey
///
/// The draw styles are designed to strike a balance between matching offline
/// renderers like RenderMan and providing high interactive performance. At
/// the time of this writing, RenderMan (as of R22) only provides two curve
/// drawing modes: a round ray oriented half tube (HALFTUBE, ROUND) and a 
/// flat primvar oriented ribbon (RIBBON, ORIENTED).
///
/// We allow all curves to be drawn as wires: for interactive guides which 
/// may not have authored width and as a performance optimization.
/// 
/// We allow for the combination of (RIBBON, ROUND) as a cheaper code path
/// which fakes a round normal on a flat camera oriented ribbon as an
/// optimization for half tubes. To alleviate aliasing, for very thin curves, 
/// we provide a HAIR mode.
/// 
/// Not all combinations of DrawStyle and NormalStyle are meaningful. For
/// example ORIENTED only makes sense with RIBBON. In the future, we hope to 
/// eliminate NormalStyle, perhaps by merging the (RIBBON, ROUND) mode into a 
/// more automatic HALFTUBE and by relying more on materials for HAIR.
