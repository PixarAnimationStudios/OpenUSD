HdSt is responsible for the core rendering functionality of the 
HdStorm Hydra renderer.

\section hdSt_overview Overview

HdSt can pull data from Hydra's renderIndex (potentially data coming from 
multiple scenegraph inputs) and it can create one or more command buffers 
that aggregate and share the underlying GPU resources, such as primvar data. 
It is optimized for both dynamically changing scenes and cached playback.
