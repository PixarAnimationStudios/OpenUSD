 *
 *				   Algorithm
 *
 * This is a Hash Chains (hc) based matchfinder.
 *
 * The main data structure is a hash table where each hash bucket contains a
 * linked list (or "chain") of sequences whose first 4 bytes share the same hash
 * code.  Each sequence is identified by its starting position in the input
 * buffer.
 *
 * The algorithm processes the input buffer sequentially.  At each byte
 * position, the hash code of the first 4 bytes of the sequence beginning at
 * that position (the sequence being matched against) is computed.  This
 * identifies the hash bucket to use for that position.  Then, this hash
 * bucket's linked list is searched for matches.  Then, a new linked list node
 * is created to represent the current sequence and is prepended to the list.
 *
 * This algorithm has several useful properties:
 *
 * - It only finds true Lempel-Ziv matches; i.e., those where the matching
 *   sequence occurs prior to the sequence being matched against.
 *
 * - The sequences in each linked list are always sorted by decreasing starting
 *   position.  Therefore, the closest (smallest offset) matches are found
 *   first, which in many compression formats tend to be the cheapest to encode.
 *
 * - Although fast running time is not guaranteed due to the possibility of the
 *   lists getting very long, the worst degenerate behavior can be easily
 *   prevented by capping the number of nodes searched at each position.
 *
 * - If the compressor decides not to search for matches at a certain position,
 *   then that position can be quickly inserted without searching the list.
 *
 * - The algorithm is adaptable to sliding windows: just store the positions
 *   relative to a "base" value that is updated from time to time, and stop
 *   searching each list when the sequences get too far away.
 *
 * ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 *
 *				 Optimizations
 *
 * The main hash table and chains handle length 4+ matches.  Length 3 matches
 * are handled by a separate hash table with no chains.  This works well for
 * typical "greedy" or "lazy"-style compressors, where length 3 matches are
 * often only helpful if they have small offsets.  Instead of searching a full
 * chain for length 3+ matches, the algorithm just checks for one close length 3
 * match, then focuses on finding length 4+ matches.
 *
 * The longest_match() and skip_bytes() functions are inlined into the
 * compressors that use them.  This isn't just about saving the overhead of a
 * function call.  These functions are intended to be called from the inner
 * loops of compressors, where giving the compiler more control over register
 * allocation is very helpful.  There is also significant benefit to be gained
 * from allowing the CPU to predict branches independently at each call site.
 * For example, "lazy"-style compressors can be written with two calls to
 * longest_match(), each of which starts with a different 'best_len' and
 * therefore has significantly different performance characteristics.
 *
 * Although any hash function can be used, a multiplicative hash is fast and
 * works well.
 *
 * On some processors, it is significantly faster to extend matches by whole
 * words (32 or 64 bits) instead of by individual bytes.  For this to be the
 * case, the processor must implement unaligned memory accesses efficiently and
 * must have either a fast "find first set bit" instruction or a fast "find last
 * set bit" instruction, depending on the processor's endianness.
 *
 * The code uses one loop for finding the first match and one loop for finding a
 * longer match.  Each of these loops is tuned for its respective task and in
 * combination are faster than a single generalized loop that handles both
 * tasks.
 *
 * The code also uses a tight inner loop that only compares the last and first
 * bytes of a potential match.  It is only when these bytes match that a full
 * match extension is attempted.
