This library contains utility classes for loading resources used by Hydra.

HioGlslfx provides interpretation of the "glslfx" file format, which is Pixar's
GPU shader container format. It supports composition of shader snippets as well
as specification of metadata that can be used for code generation purposes.

HioImage provides a plugin-based image/texture-reading abstraction, and is used
by hdStorm for all image I/O.  Hydra provides two implementations: HioStb_Image
and HioOIIO_Image.  Stb is compiled by default, whereas the OIIO plugin is only
compiled when USD is built against OpenImageIO.

Hydra integrations can include support for other image libraries by defining new
HioImage subclasses and adding appropriate plugin metadata to plugInfo.json;
hio/plugInfo.json contains the general idea.  When Hydra is asked to load a
certain file format (image.FOO), it will return the HioImage base class for
which:
(1) FOO is listed in the "imageTypes" array; and
(2) in the case of multiple matches, the highest numerical value of precedence.

Note that Stb has a higher precedence than OpenImageIO, meaning that for image
types that both plugins support, the Stb version will be used. Integration 
authors will want to choose their own precedence values accordingly.

HioFieldTextureData provides a similar plugin-based abstraction for adding
volume field readers, but does not include a precedence.
