## Overview

HdEmbree implements a Hydra renderer plugin based on Intel's Embree raytracing
kernels. HdEmbree is provided as a minimal example of how to write a renderer
plugin for hydra; it aims to be living documentation of that API.

The embree API is prefixed by "rtc", for raytracing core, and documentation is
available [here](https://embree.github.io/api.html).

The hydra image generation algorithm (as implemented in HdEngine::Execute) has
three main phases: sync, commit resources, and execution of tasks. At
each point, hydra delegates some responsibility to the renderer plugin.

## Sync

Hydra tracks scene state in the HdRenderIndex datastructure. Before generating
images, hydra updates scene state with HdRenderIndex::SyncAll(). Each prim
(scene object) is bound to an HdSceneDelegate object, which acts as its
datasource; SyncAll loops through each prim calling Sync(), which pulls new
scene data from the scene delegate and updates the renderable representation.

The render index uses an instance of HdRenderDelegate to create prim classes,
and render delegates are specialized for each renderer so that they can create
the appropriate renderable representation. HdEmbree provides
HdEmbreeRenderDelegate, which can create HdEmbreeInstancer and HdEmbreeMesh.
Together, these classes insert mesh objects and mesh instances into the
embree scene, so that drawing code can raycast against them.

In order to support the standard hydra render task, HdxRenderTask, the scene
delegate also supports a basic camera type, HdCamera.

## Commit Resources

After updating the render index, but before running tasks, HdEngine::Execute()
calls the render delegate's CommitResources(). This gives the renderer a chance
to commit the results of the sync phase, e.g. by copying buffers to the GPU or
doing a final rebuild of intersection datastructures. HdEmbree calls rtcCommit
here, which does a multithreaded rebuild of the embree bounding volume
hierarchy.

## Executing tasks

The last phase of HdEngine::Execute() is running tasks. Hydra tasks are
schedulable callbacks that can be used to render, to maintain scene state,
or to interleave execution with other renderers or libraries.

Hydra provides HdxRenderTask as a way to simply render a scene. HdxRenderTask
takes collections and render parameters as inputs, and maps them to a set of
render passes, created by the render delegate. Collections specify which parts
of the scene to draw (by include/exclude paths), and how to draw them (via the
repr token).

HdEmbree provides HdEmbreeRenderPass, which draws by raycasting into the embree
scene that's been populated by HdEmbree prim objects. The raycasting is done
in a parallel for loop, and the results are blitted to the GL framebuffer.

Note: HdEmbreeRenderPass currently doesn't support collection include/exclude
paths, so it draws everything in every renderpass. Rendering with multiple
embree render passes is unsupported, since they'll write over each other
instead of compositing.

## Renderer Plugin

HdEmbree fits into the hydra runtime as a plugin, and the discoverable class
is HdEmbreeRendererPlugin. The plugin class's only responsibility is to
create instances of HdEmbreeRenderDelegate.

## Embree Scene Ownership

The embree scene that renderpasses raycast against lives in
HdEmbreeRenderDelegate. Because of this, each render index should have a
distinct render delegate. The scene is passed to prims during Sync() via the
HdEmbreeRenderParam object, and the scene is passed to renderpasses through the
constructor.

## Configuration

Embree exports some configuration parameters, controllable by environment
variable, through the HdEmbreeConfig class.

## Unit Test

testHdEmbree provides an example of how to write a minimal hydra application.
It uses HdSt_UnitTestGLDrawing to create a window and provide a GL framebuffer,
and Hd_UnitTestDelegate to provide a simple scene graph/data source. The scene
is then rendered by running HdxRenderTask via HdEngine::Execute().
