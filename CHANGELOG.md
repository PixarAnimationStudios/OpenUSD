### Added
- Build:
  - build_usd.py can be given custom arguments for building libraries via the
    `--build-args` option.
  - Option to disable building usdview by specifying `PXR_BUILD_USDVIEW=OFF` 
    when running cmake or `--no-usdview` when running build_usd.py.
  - Allow specifying `Boost_USE_STATIC_LIBS` to cmake on Windows. Note that 
    static boost libraries may lead to issues with Python bindings. (Issue #407)

- USD:
  - ArAsset and ArResolver::OpenAsset interfaces allowing resolvers to control
    how data for a given asset is accessed.
  - "Package" asset and layer concepts to Ar and Sdf, including 
    "package-relative" asset path syntax for addressing assets within packages.
  - sdffilter utility for inspecting and summarizing the contents of a layer.
  - .usdz file format. This format allows multiple assets (including layers, 
    textures, etc.) to be packaged into a single file that can be consumed by
    USD without being unpacked to disk. These files can be created via the 
    "usdzip" command-line utility or via APIs like UsdZipFileWriter and 
    UsdUtilsCreateNewUsdzPackage.
  - UsdStage::GetObjectAtPath for retrieving a generic UsdObject. (PR #390)
  - UsdCollectionAPI can represent collections that include all paths or exclude
    some paths but include all others via the new "includeRoot" attribute.

    OSL support must be enabled by specifying `PXR_ENABLE_OSL_SUPPORT=TRUE` 
    when running cmake.
  - usdMtlx plugin containing USD file format and shader definition registry 
    plugins based on MaterialX 1.36.0. MaterialX support must be enabled by

    computed deformation.

- Imaging:
  - Per-prim adaptive refinement enabled via materials in hdSt.
  - Preliminary AOV support in Hydra with sample implementation in Embree 
    plugin.

  - "additionalLocations" parameter to PxrUsdInVariantSelect
  - "asArchive" option to PxrUsdIn. When enabled, a "usd archive" location will 
    be created rather than loading the USD data directly. This is intended for 
    passing along to renderers which support reading USD natively.
  - PxrUsdIn supports a "sharedLooksCacheKey" attribute to permit sharing cached
    USD shading information across multiple references/instances which are known
    to be identical from a pipeline standpoint.

- Houdini plugin:
  - Support import of Scope prims.

### Changed
- Build:
  - USD resource files are now installed into <prefix>/lib/usd instead of
    <prefix>/share/usd/plugins to bring them closer to the installed libraries.
  - OpenGL dependency in imaging is now optional and may be disabled by 
    specifying `PXR_ENABLE_GL_SUPPORT=FALSE` when running cmake. This will 
    disable all GL-based functionality, including usdview.
  - OpenImageIO dependency imaging is now optional and is disabled by default. 
    Support must be enabled by specifying `PXR_BUILD_OPENIMAGEIO_PLUGIN=TRUE`
    when running CMake or `--openimageio` when running build_usd.py.

- USD:
  - Numerous fixes and cleanup changes throughout to improve performance, 
    convert code to more modern patterns, and remove unneeded uses of boost.

    for asset resolution. Clients can use ArGetUnderlyingResolver in the special
    cases where access to the exact subclass is necessary.
  - ArResolver context and scoped cache functions are now public and have been
    renamed to match convention. Resolvers that override these functions will 
    need to be updated.
  - ArDefaultResolver default context for an asset now includes the directory
    of the asset in its search path.
  - Optimizations to prim change processing in UsdStage. In one example, 
    processing time for adding new prims decreased ~50%.
  - New .usdc files now default to version 0.7.0, which includes compression
    features introduced in earlier releases. These files cannot be read in USD
    releases prior to v0.8.4. Users can revert to writing older versions by
    setting the environment variable `USD_WRITE_NEW_USDC_FILES_AS_VERSION`
    to an older version.
  - Several changes to provide cleaner and more detailed runtime error messages.
  - Better support for generating code for properties of multiple-apply API
    schemas in usdGenSchema.
  - Schema types are now specified using the UsdSchemaType enum instead of 
    individual flags.
  - "expansionRule" attribute for UsdCollectionAPI is now optional; collections
    are created simply by calling UsdCollectionAPI::ApplyCollection.
  - UsdGeomBBoxCache's bounds computation now includes all defined prims,
    including those with no type specified.
  - UsdRiMaterialAPI now writes standardized "ri:surface" output by default 
    instead of deprecated "ri:bxdf".
  - UsdRiStatementsAPI now writes ri attributes as primvars by default.
  - Renamed UsdSkelPackedJointAnimation schema to UsdSkelAnimation

  data alignment. In these cases, users can simply re-export the file 
  to activate zero-copy access.

  Users can set the environment variable `USDC_ENABLE_ZERO_COPY_ARRAYS` to 0 
  to disable this feature. Users can also track cases where array data is 
  copied due to modifications by setting the environment variable
  `VT_LOG_STACK_ON_ARRAY_DETACH_COPY` to 1.

  This can be enabled by setting the `USD_KATANA_ALLOW_CUSTOM_MATERIAL_SCOPES`
  environment variable to 1.
- Refactor material loading in Katana plugin so that material locations aren't 
  computed all at once and site ops can run on each location individually.
- Improved construction of material terminal outputs in Katana plugin.
- Caching improvements in Houdini plugin to share USD stages between loaded
  primitives when possible.
- Improved error handling and reporting in Houdini plugin.
- USD stage masking in Houdini plugin can now be disabled via 
  `GUSD_STAGEMASK_ENABLE` environment variable.

  when sources were outside the scope of the point instancer. (Issue #286)

## [0.8.3] - 2018-02-05

### Added
- Compression in .usdc files for integer arrays and scalar floating point 
  arrays. The latter are compressed if the values are all integers or there 
  are a small number of unique values. In the example Kitchen Set asset on 
  the USD website, the total size of the geometry layers decreased by ~46%, 
  from 25 MB to 14 MB.

  .usdc files with this new compression enabled are marked as version 0.6.0
  and are not readable by earlier releases. These files are not written by
  default; this may be enabled by setting the environment variable 
  `USD_WRITE_NEW_USDC_FILES_AS_VERSION` to "0.6.0".
- Ability to record and query API schemas that have been applied to a prim
  via new Apply method on API schema classes, UsdPrim::GetAppliedSchemas and

- Layer identifiers may now include '?' characters. (Issue #289)
- UsdStage preserves payload load state when processing instancing changes.
- UsdListPosition enum values now specify the "append" or "prepend" list as 
  well as a position to provide users with finer-grained control.
- The various Add... methods in Usd that take a UsdListPosition argument
  now author entries to the back of the "prepend" list by default if no
  "explicit" list exists. The old behavior of authoring to the (now 
  deprecated) "added" list can be restored by setting the environment
  variable `USD_AUTHOR_OLD_STYLE_ADD` to 1.
- Standard schema conventions are more strictly-enforced in usdGenSchema.
- UsdCollectionAPI::AddCollection has been renamed ApplyCollection.

- The "added" list for list ops in scene description is deprecated in favor 
  of the "prepend" and "append" lists.

### Removed
- GfCamera::ZUp and GfCamera::YUp.

  locations, which could have led to runtime errors. (Issue #315, Issue #325)
- Headers are now installed properly for monolithic builds. (Issue #277)
- Original install location will no longer be searched for plugins after
  relocating builds. (Issue #363)
- Fixed thread-safety issue where plugins with the same name but in different
  locations could be loaded twice. (Issue #358)

## [0.8.2] - 2017-12-01

Release 0.8.2 increments the file format version for .usdc files. New .usdc
files created in this release will not be readable by earlier releases. See
below for more details.

### Added
- SdfCopySpec for copying scene description specs in layers.
- Usd.GetVersion() for retrieving USD version in Python (Issue #306)
- UsdProperty::FlattenTo for copying a UsdProperty's resolved metadata/values.
- IsTyped and IsConcrete schema queries on UsdSchemaRegistry and UsdSchemaBase. 
- UsdCollectionAPI schema for representing collections of objects. This schema
  is more expressive than UsdGeomCollectionAPI and can represent large numbers
  of objects compactly.
- Utility functions in UsdUtils for determining compact representations of
  objects for UsdCollectionAPI.
- UsdUtilsCoalescingDiagnosticDelegate, a Tf diagnostic delegate that provides
  condensed output for diagnostic messages.
- UsdUtilsFlattenLayerStack for flattening a UsdStage's layer stack into a
  single layer, as well as a --flattenLayerStack option to usdcat.
- Support for named clip sets for clip stitching API in UsdUtils.
- Schema for cards rendering in UsdGeomModelAPI and imaging support. This
  provides a lightweight way to collapse model hierarchies into simple
  geometry for visualization of large scenes.
- Ability to encode familyType on owners of families of UsdGeomSubsets.
- Size properties for UsdLuxDiskLight, UsdLuxSphereLight, and UsdLuxRectLight. 
  (Issue #290)
- Support for computing bounding boxes for UsdGeomPointInstancer instances 
  using UsdGeomBBoxCache.
- Support for residual GPU computations in Hydra.
- Sheer display mode in Hydra, a 'see-through' display mode akin to the
  mesh being covered in a sheer mesh fabric instead of its regular surface.
  Implemented as a regular grid stipple pattern of the surface at 20% opacity.
- Testing framework for usdview.
- PxrUsdMayaXformStack for representing transform stacks in the Maya plugin.
- Support for exporting Maya instancers to UsdGeomPointInstancers in the Maya
  plugin.
- Support for exporting groups of objects with the same material binding as
  collections encoded with UsdCollectionAPI in the Maya plugin.
- Support for vec4 primvars in the Katana plugin.
- Support for point instancers with varying topology that don't have authored 
  velocities in the Katana plugin.
- Support for importing collections encoded with new UsdCollectionAPI schema
  in the Katana plugin.
- Support for overriding data on a subset of point instancer instances in
  the Houdini plugin.

### Changed
- Build system now checks that the compiler being used supports 64-bit builds. 
- Tf diagnostic warnings and status messages issued in secondary threads are
  no longer printed to the terminal.
- Multiple delegates may now be registered with the Tf diagnostic system.
- SdfLayer::RemoveInertSceneDescription removes inert overs in variants.
- When saving a new .usdc file over an existing file, data is first saved to a 
  temporary file then renamed to the destination file. This provides some 
  protection for other processes that were reading the old file.
- Compression for structural sections in .usdc files is now enabled by default.
  New .usdc files will be marked as version 0.4.0 instead of 0.3.0 to 
  accommodate a bug fix described below. This means that any new .usdc files 
  created in this release will not be readable by previous USD releases.

  Users can disable the compression functionality by setting the environment
  variable `USD_WRITE_NEW_USDC_FILES_AS_VERSION` to "0.0.1". This will ensure 
  new .usdc files will be readable in older releases.

- UsdStage now uses the composed layer offset instead of its inverse when
  mapping times in layers to the stage. For example, to shift the time samples
  in a referenced layer stack forward by 10, users previously authored an
  offset of -10. Under the new behavior, users need to author an offset of 10
  instead. 

  Users can revert to the old behavior by setting the environment variable
  `USD_USE_INVERSE_LAYER_OFFSET` to 1. This will be deprecated in a future 
  release.

- UsdStage now allows a prim to be loaded without loading its descendants via
  a new UsdLoadPolicy argument supplied to UsdStage::Load and LoadAndUnload.
- UsdInherits, UsdSpecializes, and UsdReferences now map non-root prim paths
  to the namespace of the edit target.
- UsdAttribute::GetTimeSamplesInInterval now supports open/finite end points.
- UsdClipsAPI now authors the dictionary-style clips metadata introduced in
  release 0.7.6 by default.
- Schemas may now define fallback values for the majority of metadata fields,
  including custom metadata fields.
- Schemas may now have more than 256 tokens defined.
- usdedit now checks `USD_EDITOR` environment variable first when determining
  which editor to use.
- Ongoing refactoring to move code from hd to hdSt in preparation for material
  support in Hydra and use of Hydra in other renderer backends.
- Several performance optimizations in Hydra and UsdImaging.
- usdview now uses a new JSON-based format for its settings file. Settings
  files from older releases will be ignored.
- Several changes to provide better support for Viewport 2.0 in Maya plugin.
- Enum attributes in Maya now have their integer values exported to USD 
  instead of their descriptive names.
- Improved attribute transfer on USD Unpack node in Houdini plugin.
- usdvisible and usdactive attributes in Houdini plugin are now integers
  instead of strings.
- Several changes to Houdini plugin for compatibility with Houdini 16.5
  and improved HDK usage.

### Deprecated
- UsdGeomCollectionAPI, in favor of new UsdCollectionAPI.

### Removed
- TfDiagnosticNotice. The Tf diagnostic system no longer emits notices; 
  consumers relying on these notices should use diagnostic delegates instead.
- UsdGeomPointInstancer prototypeDrawMode attribute. Consumers should use
  the new drawMode attributes on UsdGeomModelAPI instead.

### Fixed
- Issue where users were forced to define certain preprocessor macros in 
  order to build code against USD. In particular, an issue introduced in 0.8.1
  caused users who did not #define PXR_ENABLE_PYTHON_SUPPORT to run into odd
  errors at runtime. (Issue #304)
- Bug that caused invalid .usdc files to be written. This affected all files
  with version 0.3.0; however, this file version was not enabled by default in
  release 0.8.1 and would only affect users who had explicitly enabled the
  new version via the `USD_WRITE_NEW_USDC_FILES_AS_VERSION` environment setting.
- Precision loss when writing time sample times to .usda files.
- Performance issue in UsdStage where memory would still be consumed by 
  child prims after their parent prim had been deactivated.
- Bug that caused UsdStage::ExpandPopulationMask to add invalid paths.
- Bug that caused UsdObject::GetMetadata to not fill in resolved paths for
  asset-valued metadata.
- Bug where layer offsets were incorrectly applied when authoring time samples.
- Bug in UsdUtilsStageCache that led to crashes during static destruction.
- Unpickable objects now act as occluders during picking in Hydra.
- Bug that caused usdview to stop drawing after "Reopen Stage" or "Open Stage".
- Bug that caused usdview to not play all frames if the step size was changed.
  (Issue #321)
- Several performance and UI issues in usdview.
- Crash in Maya plugin with nested assemblies and variant set selections.
  (Issue #288)
- Bug in Maya plugin where exporting over a previously-imported layer failed.
- Bug in Maya plugin that caused lights to flip between directional and 
  non-directional in legacy viewport.
- Various issues that prevented UsdKatana Python module from being imported.
  (Issue #323)

## [0.8.1] - 2017-10-02

### Added
- "append" and "prepend" operations for SdfListOp-valued fields.
  Scene description layers that contain these new operations will not be
  readable by earlier USD releases.
- `--validate` argument to sdfdump for checking file validity.
- Support for sub-root references and payloads.
- Ability to specify amount of data to prefetch when reading a .usdc
  file via the `USDC_MMAP_PREFETCH_KB` environment variable.
- Debugging output that shows memory mapping information for .usdc files.
  This can be enabled via the `USDC_DUMP_PAGE_MAPS` environment variable.
- UsdGeomMotionAPI schema.
- UsdGeomSubset schema for representing a subset of a geometric prim.
- Hydra GL support for displacement shaders
- Initial experimental support for PySide2 in usdview. By default, the 
  build will search for PySide, then PySide2. Alternatively, users may specify 
  `PYSIDE_USE_PYSIDE2=TRUE` to CMake to force the use of PySide2.
- Ability to view connections and relationship targets in usdview.
- Support for camera clipping range in Alembic plugin.
- Support for array attributes with "RfM Shaders" shading mode in Maya exporter.
- Support for angularVelocities attribute on point instancers in Katana plugin.
- Filtered view and improved selection to Tree View panel in Houdini plugin.
- Support for prototype offsets in point instancer exports in Houdini plugin.

### Changed
- Made Python dependency optional. Python support is enabled by default but
  may be disabled by specifying `PXR_ENABLE_PYTHON_SUPPORT=FALSE` to CMake
  or `--no-python` to build_usd.py.
- build_usd.py now requires that users install PyOpenGL manually. (Issue #264)
- Replaced addedOrExplicitItems attribute on Sdf.*ListOp in Python with
  GetAddedOrExplicitItems method.
- Renamed Append... methods on composition arc APIs (e.g. UsdReferences, 
  UsdInherits) to Add... and added a position argument to support new
  "append" and "prepend" operations. 

  Calling these functions with the default UsdListPositionTempDefault argument
  will author "add" operations, maintaining the previous behavior. We anticipate
  removing UsdListPositionTempDefault and replacing it with UsdListPositionFront
  so that "prepend" operations will be authored by default in 0.8.2. Users may 
  enable this behavior now by setting the `USD_AUTHOR_OLD_STYLE_ADD` environment
  variable to false.

- UsdStage now issues warnings for invalid layers it encounters instead of
  errors, which cause exceptions in Python.
- Code generation templates and schema.usda files used by usdGenSchema are 
  now installed as part of the build. Schemas can now use asset paths like
  "usdGeom/schema.usda" or "usdShade/schema.usda" instead of absolute paths
  to add installed schemas as sublayers. (Issue #158, #211)
- Improved USD scenegraph instancing to allow more sharing of assets with
  inherits or specializes arcs. In one large example, this decreased stage load
  time by ~60%, stage memory usage by ~65%, and time to first image in usdview 
  by ~20%.
- Several optimizations to reduce I/O operations for .usda and .usdc files.
- Add support for compressed structural sections in .usdc files. This can
  significantly decrease file sizes for files that are dominated by prim and
  property hierarchy; one production shading file decreased in size by ~94%,
  from 21 MB to 1.3 MB.

  Compressed files are marked as version 0.3.0 and are not readable by earlier 
  USD releases. To help with transition, USD will not write these compressed 
  files by default until a future release. Users may enable this feature now 
  by setting the `USD_WRITE_NEW_USDC_FILES_AS_VERSION` environment variable 
  to "0.3.0". We plan to add compression for geometry data and time samples
  in a future release.

- UsdUtilsExtractExternalReferences now checks for references to external files
  in property values and metadata.
- Increased precision for rotations attribute in UsdSkelPackedJointAnimation 
  schema to 32-bit.
- UsdGeomPrimvar now allows primvar names with arbitrarily-nested namespaces.
- Sizeable refactor in Hydra to support sprims more like rprims in anticipation 
  of future lights and material support.
- Hydra no longer syncs rprims that are not visible.
- Several performance and stability fixes to point instancer handling in Hydra.
- "Reload All Layers" in usdview will try not to reset the camera or timeline.
- Numerous other improvements to usdview.
- The Alembic reader now converts single samples for properties in .abc files
  to single time samples in USD, instead of default values.
- Updated required Katana version to Katana 2.5v1.
- Improved bounds computations for point instancers in Katana plugin
- Account for motion sample time overrides when computing bounding boxes in
  Katana plugin.
- Improved stage cache in Houdini plugin, which can have significantly
  better performance in some circumstances.
- Improved handling of instanced USD primitives in Houdini plugin.

### Deprecated
- UsdGeomFaceSetAPI and related API in usdShade and usdLux in favor of new 
  UsdGeomSubset schema.

### Removed
- UsdStage::Close.
- Camera zUp-related functionality
- Support for faceVaryingInterpolateBoundary in UsdGeomMesh schema.
  See faceVaryingLinearInterpolation instead.

### Fixed
- Bug in build_usd.py where specifying `--no-embree` did the opposite.
  (Issue #276)
- Bug in build_usd.py where specifying `--force-all` or `--force` on a
  Python dependency would cause the script to error out early. (Issue #263)
- Race condition between TfType consumers and TfType registry initialization.
- Composition bug where references with the same prim path and relative asset
  path would be considered duplicates even when anchoring location differed.
- Composition bug where payloads on arcs requiring ancestral opinions could
  result in errors.
- Change processing bug when removing sublayers specified by search path.
- Stack overflow crash when reading .usdc files due to excessive recursion.
- Possible crash in Hydra when using basis curves.
- Memory leak in Hydra task controller.
- Build issue for Alembic plugin with HDF5 support disabled when
  precompiled headers are enabled (which is the default on Windows).
- Several other bugs in Alembic reader.
- Performance issue in Katana plugin due to inefficiency in UsdShadeNodeGraph.

  usdwritestaticprimvars, and usdwritestaticgeo attributes.
- Added UsdExportAttributes hda to Houdini plugin for setting primitive and 
  detail attributes which control various USD attributes or metadata.

### Changed

- Asset paths in .usda files may now contain any printable character.
  (Issue #73)
- Legacy special behavior for variant sets named "standin" has been disabled
  by default.
- Interpolation is now applied to time samples from clips when no sample
  exists at a specified clip time.
- Removed deprecated UsdShadePShader schema.

### Added
- Added `build_scripts/build_usd.py` for building USD and its dependencies.
- Added support for building static libraries or a single monolithic
  shared library. See [BUILDING.md](BUILDING.md#linker-options) for more
  details.
- Added support for color spaces to Usd. Color configuration and management 
  system can be specified on a UsdStage (via the stage's root layer), and 
  colorSpace metadata is available on any UsdAttribute.
- Added clip set functionality to Usd. This provides the ability to specify 
  multiple sets of value clips on the same prim, which allows users to compose 
  different sets of clips together. See UsdClipsAPI for more details.
- Added initial UsdLux schemas for representing interchangeable lights and 
  related concepts, and UsdRi schemas for Renderman-specific extensions. 
  UsdImaging/Hydra support will be coming in a future release.
- Added ability to specify smooth triangle subdivision scheme for catmullClark
  surfaces in UsdGeomMesh and imaging support in Hydra.
- Added backdrops for node layout description in UsdUI.
- Added support for sharing immutable primvar buffers to Hydra.
  This can greatly reduce the memory required on the GPU when displaying
  typical scenes. It is currently experimental and disabled by default. It
  can be enabled for testing with the environment variable
  `HD_ENABLE_SHARED_VERTEX_PRIMVAR`.
- Added support for uniform primvars for basis curves in Hydra.

  prim info in usdview. 
- Added initial version of Houdini plugin.

### Changed

- Removed unnecessary dependency on OpenImageIO binaries.
- Removed unnecessary dependency on boost::iostreams.
- Made HDF5 backend for Alembic plugin optional. HDF5 support is enabled by 
  default but may be disabled by specifying `PXR_ENABLE_HDF5_SUPPORT=FALSE`
  to CMake.
- Metadata fields for value clips feature in UsdStage (e.g. clipAssetPaths,
  clipTimes, etc.) have been deprecated in favor of the new clips metadata
  dictionary. Authoring APIs on UsdClipsAPI still write out the deprecated
  metadata unless the environment variable `USD_AUTHOR_LEGACY_CLIPS` is set 
  to 0. This will be disabled in a future release.
- When using value clips, Usd will now report time samples at each time 
  authored in the clip times metadata.
- Completed support for encoding UsdShade data using UsdAttribute connections.
  Authoring APIs still write out the old encoding, unless the environment 
  variable `USD_SHADE_WRITE_NEW_ENCODING` is set to 1. This will be enabled
  in a future release.
- Removed support for deprecated UsdShade schemas UsdShadeParameter and
  UsdShadeInterfaceAttribute, which have been superseded by UsdShadeInput.

  plugged in to Hydra.
- UsdImaging now pushes GL_DEPTH_BUFFER_BIT to avoid any potential state
  pollution issues when integrating it with other renderers. 
- Improved error handling in Hydra for:
  - Invalid point instancer input
  - Inconsistent displayColor and displayOpacity primvars
  - Direct instances of imageable prims
- usdview more gracefully handles the situation where it doesn't get a
  valid GL context (e.g., due to limited resources on the GPU).
- Improved how edits are handled on assembly nodes in the Maya plugin.
- Improved UsdGeomPointInstancer support in the Katana plugin:
  - Overhauled methods for computing instance transforms and aggregate bounds. 
  - Backward motion and multi-sampled point instancer positions, orientations, 
    and scales are now supported.
  - Removed opArgs attributes that were used for configuring the reader's 
    behavior.
  - More robust primvar transfer to point instancer's Katana locations.
  - Restructured prototype building logic to preserve material bindings
    when creating prototype prims.

C++ namespaces are now enabled by default. The `PXR_ENABLE_NAMESPACES` CMake
option may be used to disable namespaces if needed.

This release adds initial experimental support for building the USD core
libraries on Windows.

### Added
- Added ability to build doxygen documentation. See
  [BUILDING.md](BUILDING.md#documentation) for more details.

  for Linux and Mac builds and enabled for Windows builds. This may be
  configured with the `PXR_ENABLE_PRECOMPILED_HEADERS` CMake option.  
- Added many unit tests for core libraries
- Added UsdStage::Save and UsdStage::SaveSessionLayers
- Added attribute connection feature that allows consumers to describe
  connections between an attribute and other prims and properties.
- Added instance proxy feature that allows consumers to interact with
  objects on a UsdStage as if scenegraph instancing were not in use while
  retaining the performance benefits of instancing.
- Plugins providing Boundable schema types can now register functions for
  computing extents. This allows code in the USD core to compute extents for
  prims with types provided by external schemas.
- Added support for specializes arcs to usdShade.
- Added UsdUISceneGraphPrimAPI for representing prim display properties.
- Added `HD_DISABLE_TINY_PRIM_CULLING` flag for `TF_DEBUG` to make it easier

  shutter open/close) on a per-scope basis in Katana plugin. Users can author
  these overrides by modifying the global graph state, then decide to use
  the default motion values with or without these overrides applied.

### Changed
- Removed OpenEXR dependency from core libraries. Note that OpenEXR is still
  required for imaging.
- Made Ptex dependency optional. It is only required if Ptex support for
  imaging is enabled. This is on by default, but can be disabled by specifying
  `PXR_ENABLE_PTEX_SUPPORT=FALSE` to CMake.
- Cleaned up and expanded doxygen documentation:
  - Added documentation for value clips and scenegraph instancing USD features.
  - Enabled XML generation for external tools
  - Fixed invalid tags and formatting in several places
- UsdTreeIterator has been replaced by UsdPrimRange, which provides 
  container-like semantics in C++ (e.g., the ability to use them in range-based
  for loops).
- Removed UsdPrim::GetPayload API
- UsdRelationship and UsdAttribute will no longer forward target/connection
  paths that point to objects within instances to objects in master prims.
  Users can use the new instance proxy functionality to work with these paths
  instead.
- Relationships belonging to prims in instances that point to the root of the
  instance no longer cause errors.
- Value clip metadata can now be sparsely overridden across composition arcs.
- Deprecated shading property schemas UsdShadeParameter and 
  UsdShadeInterfaceAttribute. These are replaced by UsdShadeInput, which can
  represent both input parameters on shaders and interface inputs on node
  graphs.
- The `--compose` command line parameter for usddiff is now `--flatten`
- Numerous cleanup changes for Hydra API. In particular:
  - HdEngine::Draw has been retired in favor of HdEngine::Execute.
  - HdSceneDelegate::IsInCollection has been deprecated in favor of render-tag
    based API.

- The Maya plugin now excludes attributes during import if they are tagged
  with customData specifying them as generated.
- Numerous changes for ongoing Mac and Windows port efforts.
- Changed scoping of built-out point instancer prototypes in Katana plugin
  so that their hierarchy more closely matches the original USD hierarchy.

### Fixed
- Added workaround to avoid redefined "_XOPEN_SOURCE" and "_POSIX_C_SOURCE" 
  macro warnings due to Python includes on Linux. (Issue #1)

- Fixed issue in Maya plugin where multiple assemblies that reference the
  same file might all be affected by the edits of one particular assembly 
  when viewing them via a proxy.
- Fixed issue in Maya plugin where path resolution was being done by the
  plugin itself rather than deferring to Usd and Sdf.

## [0.7.4] - 2017-03-03

USD now supports C++ namespaces. They are disabled by default in this release
to ease transition, but we anticipate enabling them by default in the next 
release. 

Specify the `PXR_ENABLE_NAMESPACES` CMake option to enable namespaces.
See documentation in [BUILDING.md](BUILDING.md#c-namespace-configuration) for more details.

### Added
- Added GfHalf type to represent half-precision numeric values. This type 
  is currently an alias to the "half" type supplied by the ilmbase library 
  USD is built against. This will be changed in an upcoming release to point 
  to a version of "half" that is included in the USD codebase, which will
  allow us to remove the USD core's dependency on ilmbase.
- Added UsdShadeInput class to represent shader or NodeGraph input.
  These are encoded as attributes in the "inputs:" namespace. By default, 
  this encoding will not be written out via UsdShadeConnectableAPI unless 
  the 'USD_SHADE_WRITE_NEW_ENCODING' environment variable is set.
- Added "Composition" tab to usdview that allows users to inspect the 
  composition structure of a selected prim.
- Added tests for Hdx. These tests are currently not run as part of the unit 
  test suite, but are being included for users to try on their platforms and 
  to serve as example code.
- Added icons for the USD assemblies in Maya.
- Added initial implementation of Katana plugin for reading 
  UsdGeomPointInstancer locations.

  - Consumers can specify what parts of a stage to populate and use
    to reduce resources used by the stage.
  - usdview now has a --mask option allowing users to view just the
    specified portion of a stage.
- Added UsdPrim API for collecting relationship targets authored 
  in a given prim subtree.

  search paths, allowing for relocatable builds as long as all
  build products are moved together as one unit.
- Removed hard-coded /usr/local/share directory from plugin search path.
- Optimized creation of prim specs in Sdf. Creating 100k prim specs 
  previously took 190s, it now takes 0.9s.

  for variant selection paths.
- UsdStage no longer issues an error if requested to unload a path that
  does not identify an unloadable object.

- Numerous changes for ongoing Mac and Windows porting efforts.
- Changed coding style to use symbol-like logical operators
  instead of the keyword-like form (e.g., '&&' instead of 'and').
- Various cleanup changes to fix comments, compiler warnings, and
  to remove unused/old code.

### Fixed
- Fixed composition bug where nested variants with the same name
  were composed incorrectly.
- Fixed composition bug where variant selections from classes
  were not being applied in certain cases. (Issue #156)
- Fixed .usda file output to write out floating point values
  using the correct precision and to use exponential representation
  for values greater than 1e15 (instead of 1e21) to avoid parsing
  issues.
- Fixed bug where negative double values that could be represented as
  floats were not stored optimally in .usdc files.
- Fixed bug where UsdPrim::Has/GetProperty would return incorrect results.
- Fixed bug where UsdObject::GetMetadata would return incorrect results
  for dictionary-valued metadata in certain cases.

## [0.7.2] - 2016-12-02

### Added
- Added ability to apply a custom prefix to shared library names
  by specifying the `PXR_LIB_PREFIX` option to CMake.
- Added ability to disable tests by using the `PXR_BUILD_TESTS` option
  with CMake.
- usddiff can now diff two directories containing USD files.
- Value clips on a prim may now be specified using 'template' clip
  metadata. This is a more compact representation for simple cases
  where each value clip corresponds to a single time code.
- Better support for non-file-backed asset resolution
  - Made ArDefaultResolver public, so that subclasses can layer
    behavior on top of it.
  - Added ArResolver API for retrieving files from data store when
    needed.
- Initial version of UsdGeomPointInstancer schema and preliminary
  support in usdImaging.
- pxrUsdReferenceAssemblies in Maya can now import animation from a USD scene.
  See http://openusd.org/docs/Maya-USD-Plugins.html#MayaUSDPlugins-ImportingasAssemblies 
  for details. 
- Core USD metadata (e.g. hidden, instanceable, kind) now roundtrips through 
  Maya, stored as "USD_XXX" attributes on corresponding Maya nodes.

### Changed
- Removed dependency on Qt. Note that PySide is still a dependency for 
  usdview.
  - Removed imaging/glfq library as part of this work.
- Modified variant behavior in composition:
  - Variants may now be nested within other variants in scene description.
    Nested variants may be authored by using nested UsdEditContext objects
    returned by UsdVariantSet::GetVariantEditContext.
  - Weaker variants may now introduce variant selections that affect
    stronger variants. Previously, these selections would be ignored 
    and the variant fallbacks would be used instead.
- Optimized .usdc file format performance in certain cases:
  - Output is buffered in memory to improve write times for layers 
    containing many nested dictionaries. In one such example, wall-clock
    time improved by ~64% and system time improved by 89%.
  - Time samples are now written out grouped by time to improve read 
    performance for frame-by-frame access patterns.
- Several optimizations to improve USD scenegraph authoring and composition 
  speed and reduce memory consumption. In some use cases, we observed:
  - ~5-7x less memory consumed by Pcp dependency tracking structures
  - ~40% less time spent to author large stages
- Exporting USD from the Maya Export window now produces binary .usd
  files by default instead of .usda files.

### Fixed
- Fixed bug where edits to a layer opened in Maya would persist when
  reopening that layer in a new scene.
- Fixed issue where exporting USD from the Maya Export window would
  produce files ending with ".usda", even if a different format
  was specified. The exporter should now respect any extension that
  is entered, so long as the "Default file extensions" option is
  turned off.
- Fixed several issues with example plugins being improperly built, making
  them unusuable, and missing functionality.
- Various other bug fixes and performance improvements.

## [0.7.1] - 2016-09-21

### Added
- UsdMaterial schema for shading, intended to replace UsdLook. Also added
  support for this new schema to Hydra.
- Initial version of UsdUI schema library, intended for encoding GUI 
  information on USD prims.
- Parallel teardown of some data members in UsdStage, speeding up overall
  teardown by ~2x.
- Support for packed vertex normals to Hydra, reducing GPU memory consumption
  by 20-30% in some cases.
- Ability to compare two composed stages to usddiff by specifying the
  "--compose" or "-c" options.
- Support for soft-selection for collapsed USD assemblies in Maya.
- Support for exporting color sets and UV sets as indexed primvars from Maya.

### Changed
- Refactored Hydra libraries to move higher-level concepts out of the core
  hd library and into hdx.
- Removed use of opensubdiv3/ include path from imaging code in favor of
  standard opensubdiv/ include.
- Modified UsdStage to automatically load newly-discovered payloads if
  their nearest ancestor's payload was also loaded. For example, consumers
  will no longer have to explicitly call UsdStage::Load to ensure payloads
  are loaded when switching variants on a prim, so long as their nearest
  ancestor is also loaded.
- Refactoring and other changes to help with Mac and Windows ports.
- Updated doxygen and other documentation.

### Fixed
- Fixed issue that caused Alembic plugin (usdAbc) to be misconfigured at
  build time, which required users to manually update its plugInfo.json
  and set an environment variable at runtime to make it work. This plugin
  is now installed to $PREFIX/plugin/usd/ and requires no additional
  steps to use once it has been built.
- Fixed issue with .usdc files that resulted in corrupted files on Windows.
  The file structure was changed, so the .usdc version has been bumped
  from 0.0.1 to 0.1.0. USD will continue to write 0.0.1 files by default,
  but will begin writing 0.1.0 files in the near future.

  Users may choose to write files with the new version immediately
  by setting the environment variable `USD_WRITE_NEW_USDC_FILES_AS_VERSION`
  to "0.1.0".

  Note that 0.0.1 files are still readable using this release, 
  except for those that have been generated on Windows using 0.7.0. 
  Early testers on Windows will need to regenerate those files
  with this release.
- Fixed issue that caused usdGenSchema to generate files that could
  not be compiled.
- Added a workaround for TBB-related issue in Maya that caused hangs when 
  using the USD Maya plugin. This can be enabled at build time by 
  specifying the `PXR_MAYA_TBB_BUG_WORKAROUND` option to CMake.
- Various other bug fixes and performance improvements.
