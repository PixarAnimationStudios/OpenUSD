# Change Log

## [21.05] - 2021-04-12

### Build
- Removed unnecessary check for Python executable in build_usd.py.
  (Issue: [#1414](https://www.github.com/PixarAnimationStudios/USD/issues/1414), 
  PR: [#1464](https://www.github.com/PixarAnimationStudios/USD/pull/1464))
- Updated build_usd.py to use MaterialX v1.38.0 and unified the MaterialX plugin 
  and imaging build options PXR_BUILD_MATERIALX_PLUGIN and 
  PXR_ENABLE_MATERIALX_IMAGING_SUPPORT into PXR_ENABLE_MATERIALX_SUPPORT.
- Exposed version numbers in pxrConfig.cmake for CMake client projects.
- Updated CHANGELOG.md to include links to pull requests and issues. 
  (Issue: [#1362](https://www.github.com/PixarAnimationStudios/USD/issues/1362))
- Fixed linking errors by removing extern C linkage from LZ4 symbols, to avoid 
  collisions with other libraries embedding LZ4. 
  (Issue: [#1447](https://www.github.com/PixarAnimationStudios/USD/issues/1447))
- Updated VERSIONS.md to include  Linux, Windows and MacOS versions used for 
  testing. Note that Windows and MacOS should still be considered experimental. 
  (PR: [#1393](https://www.github.com/PixarAnimationStudios/USD/pull/1393))

### USD
- Added UsdUtils.UpdateSchemaWithSdrNode functionality for creating or updating 
  a schema.usda from specially curated sdrShaderNode and sdrShaderProperty 
  metadata.
- Updated usdGenSchema to not error when generating a dynamic schema and 
  libraryPath is not specified.
- The default 'USD' SdrShaderNodes generated from UsdLuxLightFilter types now 
  have the context of "lightFilter" like other light filter shader nodes.
- Fixed bug where the registered URI resolver would not be invoked for a URI 
  asset path if it was shorter than the longest registered URI schema.
- The template asset path field for value clips now supports Sdf file format 
  arguments. 
  (PR: [#1450](https://www.github.com/PixarAnimationStudios/USD/pull/1450))
- SdfLayer::ListFields now includes "required fields" for each spec type.
- A collection of fixes and tests for Windows path handling, especially 
  involving symlinks. 
  (PR: [#1441](https://www.github.com/PixarAnimationStudios/USD/pull/1441),
  [#1465](https://www.github.com/PixarAnimationStudios/USD/pull/1465), 
  [#1468](https://www.github.com/PixarAnimationStudios/USD/pull/1468),
  Issues: [#1440](https://www.github.com/PixarAnimationStudios/USD/issues/1440))
- Fixed usdGenSchema to honor apiName metadata for auto generated tokens.h. This 
  results in correct doxygen documentation for the correct API names.
- UsdUtilsStitchClips now creates a separate manifest layer instead of using the 
  topology layer as the manifest layer. This is because the topology layer can 
  contain attributes that actually don't have any time samples in clips. 
  (Issue: [#1344](https://www.github.com/PixarAnimationStudios/USD/issues/1344))
- Added documentation for built-in and auto-applied API schemas.
- Added additional plugInfo mechanism (via AutoApplyAPISchemas metadata) to 
  define auto apply API schemas, to allow context/site specific auto application 
  of API schemas.
- Added FlattenTo function to UsdPrimDefinition to copy the contents of a prim 
  definition into a prim spec on a layer.
- Updated UsdShadeConnectableAPI::Get{Inputs,Outputs} to only return authored 
  inputs/outputs by default. Optional onlyAuthored=false argument can be passed 
  to explicitly include Builtins. Results in performance improvement at code 
  sites like UsdShadeShaderDefUtils.
- UsdLux Shadow and Shaping APIs are now connectable. All attributes on these 
  APIs have been given the "inputs:" prefix.
- Adding support for identifier aliases in Ndr/Sdr. This allows NdrRegistry to 
  use these aliases to find the node through the GetNodeByIdentifierAPIs when 
  there are no appropriate nodes that exactly match the identifier being 
  searched for.
- Performance improvement in terminal resolution in UsdShade. Introduced a 
  `shaderOutputOnly` flag on the GetValueProducingAttributes function, this 
  allows us to get only the type of connections we want and avoid the cost of 
  the extra checks.
- Updated NdrRegistry::GetNodeFromAsset() to use asset name and extension as the 
  node name instead of the identifier. Note that node name is not expected to be 
  unique for a NdrNode.
- Fixed a pcp change processing bug where we did not consider layers with 
  replaced content significant wrt layer stacks that use the layer. 
  (Issue: [#1407](https://www.github.com/PixarAnimationStudios/USD/issues/1407))
- Removed UsdShadeConnectableAPI implicit constructors from UsdShadeShader and 
  UsdShadeNodeGraph to enforce independence of connectability concept from 
  shader graphs. Callers are required to convert these explicitly now, which can 
  be done via the ConnectableAPI() method on Shader and NodeGraph.
- Updated connectability rules in UsdShadeConnectableAPIBehavior to improve 
  encapsulation. Refer to the UsdShade documentation for details on 
  connectability rules.
- usdGenSchema now adds a type alias for abstract typed schemas, which means 
  abstract typed schemas now have an official USD type name which is registered 
  with the UsdSchemaRegistry.
- Auto apply API schemas in USD can now specify abstract typed schemas to auto 
  apply to, indicating that the API should be applied to all schemas that derive 
  from the abstract schema type.
- Removed deprecated UsdConnectableAPI::IsShader() and IsNodeGraph() APIs.
- Fixed performance regression in UsdStage change processing when applying an 
  API schema.
- Make OSL parser for Sdr more robust to dynamic array type names.
- Backwards compatibility for the deprecated "UsdSchemaType" terminology will be 
  removed in the next release. Schemas that have not been updated since v21.02 
  must be regenerated to avoid breakage in the next release.


### Imaging
- Added SampleIndexedPrimvar() and GetIndexedPrimvar() scene delegate API to 
  allow users to access unflattened primvars and their indices.
- Added support for time-sampled computed primvars in the scene delegate API 
  (including an UsdImaging implementation for Skel). 
  (PR: [#1455](https://www.github.com/PixarAnimationStudios/USD/pull/1455))
- Added GetInstancerPrototypes() scene delegate API to return prim paths that 
  are prototypes of an instancer.
- Added support for GetMaterialResource() to the lightAdapter and 
  lightFilterAdapter classes so the usdImaging scene delegate can provide 
  HdMaterialNetworks for lights and filters.
- Added imaging adapters for UsdLuxPluginLight and UsdLuxPluginLightFilter.
- Added optimization when checking primvar existence, use Get() instead of 
  ComputeFlattened().
- Renamed render delegate API GetMaterialNetworkSelector() to 
  GetMaterialRenderContexts() to allow for multiple material render contexts.
- Moved version tracking of batches from HdChangeTracker to Storm’s render 
  delegate.
- Moved garbage collection API to Storm’s render delegate.
- Refactored the free camera code in HdxTaskController::_Delegate into its own 
  HdxFreeCameraSceneDelegate.
- Removed obsolete HdTexture bprim.
- Various improvements to Hio:
   - Refactored reading of HioImage and the conversion to an HgiFormat into 
     common functionality.
   - Moved volume field texture loading out of Glf. Volume data is loaded via a 
     plugin point (hioOpenVDB) in HioFieldTextureData.
   - Replaced GlfGetNumElements(HioFormat) and GlfGetElementSize(HioFormat) with 
     equivalent functions in Hio.
   - The HioOIIO OpenImageIO plugin supports format conversion when loading 
     image data, so we specify the target format in the destination image spec.
   - As the transition to Hio (and our new texture system) continues to move 
     forward, we are now removing many entry points in Glf.
- Fixed crash on Hydra update when a prototype primitive is removed (deleted or 
  deactivated) in the same update cycle where an inheritable primvar is added or 
  changed to an ancestor of the prototype that used to exist. 
  (PR: [#1418](https://www.github.com/PixarAnimationStudios/USD/pull/1418), 
  Issue: [#1417](https://www.github.com/PixarAnimationStudios/USD/issues/1417))

  (Issue: [#1437](https://www.github.com/PixarAnimationStudios/USD/issues/1437))
- Fixed material binding improvements for point instancer prototypes. 
  (Issue: [#1449](https://www.github.com/PixarAnimationStudios/USD/issues/1449))
- Fixed instance highlighting for native instances when the selected instance is 
  invisible. 
  (Issue: [#1461](https://www.github.com/PixarAnimationStudios/USD/issues/1461))
- Fixed PointInstancerAdapter Get() to properly call the fallback if it can't 
  find the requested key. 
  (Issue: [#1439](https://www.github.com/PixarAnimationStudios/USD/issues/1439))

  will write the AOVs into.
- Added casts to avoid GLSL compile errors when enabling 
  HD_ENABLE_DOUBLE_MATRIX and using the volume raymarcher.
- Added GlfAnySharedGLContextScopeHolder that is a conditional 
  GlfSharedGLContextScopeHolder only switching the shared context if there is no 
  current valid context.
- Added number of texture objects and handles to 
  HdStResourceRegistry::GetResourceAllocation.
- Changed Ptex layout texture format in order to improve compatibility on 
  platforms which don't support 3-component textures.
- Disabled bindless textures while we investigate unexpected performance 
  regressions related to switching context and bindless.
- Optimization to bail out early for Storm tasks that have no work.
- Avoid invalidation in the renderpass shader when processing buffer binding 
  requests.

  HdSt_BasisCurvesPrimvarInterpolaterComputation.
- Fixed to trigger draw item gather when material tag changes
- Fixed HgiBufferDesc byteSize calculations to avoid reading beyond initialized 
  data when creating buffer objects.
- Renamed renderPassShader.glslfx to renderPassColorShader.glslfx to clarify its 
  intent.

   - Fixed resolve op to transfer data from/to all attachments.
   - Fixed a potential bug where the wrong size was computed for a compressed 
     array texture.
   - Fixed code generation for unsigned and signed integer textures.
   - Fixed redundant depth buffer resolve and ensure that in the absence of 
     color attachments, it still gets resolved.
   - Fixed Metal error related to resource lifetime.

### RenderMan Hydra Plugin
- Updated RenderMan version required by hdPrman to 23.5.
- NOTE: The USD release following the RenderMan 24 release will increase the 
  required version once more to 24.0. In other words, this will likely be the 
  last USD release with hdPrman support for RenderMan 23.x.
- Made the rman args parser map `bxdf` types inputs to the Sdr `terminal` type.
- Finishing work to support fieldDataType and vectorDataRoleHint for UsdVol 
  prims in hdPrman.


### MaterialX Support
- Minimum of MaterialX v1.38 is now required.
- MaterialX support in Storm:
   - Added basic support for textures.
   - Added basic support for direct lights.
   - Added a Mtlx render context, which gets consumed by Storm’s render 
     delegate.
   - Register MaterialX nodes as having "mtlx" source type and allow Storm’s 
     material network to accept both glslfx and mtlx sourcetypes.
   - Changed the MaterialX option from FIS to Specular Environment Prefilter.
   - Fixed u_envMatrix calculation to account for y-up/z-up/domelight 
     transform.
- Various improvements to the usdMtlx plugin:
   - Record "geomprop" references from materialx into Sdr's "primvars" 
     metadata. This lets clients query which primvars the material wants access 
     to (for purposes such as primvar filtering).
   - No longer copying default values on shader inputs to each USD shader 
     definition to improve performance and keep it more consistent with other 
     UsdShade constructs.
   - Removed deprecated references to shaderref, Color2.
   - Fixed a crash in UsdMtlx when reading mtlx nodes that use a MaterialX 
     standard shader nodedef.

### Build
- Updated CMakeLists.txt to conform to recommended practice. 
  (Issue: [#1241](https://www.github.com/PixarAnimationStudios/USD/issues/1241))
- The build system now sets `Boost_NO_BOOST_CMAKE=ON` by default to
  work around issues with boost's cmake files. 
  (Issue: [#1255](https://www.github.com/PixarAnimationStudios/USD/issues/1255))

- Various fixes and changes to build_usd.py:
  - Added `--toolset` option for specifying CMake toolset. 
    (PR: [#1325](https://www.github.com/PixarAnimationStudios/USD/pull/1325))

  issue is still present in Python 3. 
  (Issue: [#1290](https://www.github.com/PixarAnimationStudios/USD/issues/1290))
- Fixed various tests to accommodate `PXR_OVERRIDE_PLUGINPATH_NAME`. 
(PR: [#1275](https://www.github.com/PixarAnimationStudios/USD/pull/1275))

- Added GetExternalAssetDependencies to SdfLayer and SdfFileFormat to allow
  file format plugins to declare additional dependencies that determine when
  a layer produced from that file format should be reloaded.

- Reduced memory usage from SdfPath::GetString and added SdfPath::GetAsString
  and SdfPath::GetAsToken to avoid populating internal caches. 
  (Issue: [#1287](https://www.github.com/PixarAnimationStudios/USD/issues/1287))

  this decreased draw times in usdview after transform changes by ~90%.
  (Issue: [#1300](https://www.github.com/PixarAnimationStudios/USD/issues/1300))

- New .usdc files now default to version 0.8.0. These files cannot be read in
  USD releases prior to v19.03. Users can revert to writing older versions by
  setting the environment variable `USD_WRITE_NEW_USDC_FILES_AS_VERSION` to an
  older version.

- Added safety checks to guard against reading malformed .usdc files. These
  checks may negatively impact performance and may be disabled by specifying
  `PXR_PREFER_SAFETY_OVER_SPEED=OFF` when running CMake or
  `--prefer-speed-over-safety` with build_usd.py.

- Native instancing "master" prims are now referred to as "prototype" prims.
  The generated paths of prototype prims has been changed from /__Master_<X>
  to /__Prototype_<X>. Clients can use new UsdPrim::IsPrototypePath and
  UsdPrim::IsPathInPrototype API to determine if a given path is related
  to a prototype.

  UsdStage and UsdPrim API using "master" terminology like UsdPrim::GetMaster
  and UsdStage::GetMasters have been deprecated and will be removed in a future
  release.

  and "auto" for better control of with which color space a texture is read.
- Added ability to use mip maps authored in a file in the new texture system in
  Storm.
- Added UsdImagingPrimAdapter::ShouldIgnoreNativeInstanceSubtrees() to allow
  adapters to disable instancing of itself and its descendants.

### USD
- Added support for "future division" in Python 2 to aid transition to Python 3.

- Added ArResolver::CreatePathForLayer to allow users to customize behavior
  when writing a layer. SdfLayer now uses this method instead of creating a
  directory, which was not appropriate for non-filesystem uses. 
  (Issue: [#1148](https://www.github.com/PixarAnimationStudios/USD/issues/1148))

- Added SdfReference::IsInternal. 
  (PR: [#1204](https://www.github.com/PixarAnimationStudios/USD/pull/1204))

  GetResolvedDefinitionURI and GetResolvedImplementationURI to properly
  represent RenderMan C++ shaders.

- Time sample times from layers whose timeCodesPerSecond value differ from
  the UsdStage are now automatically scaled to match. This can be disabled
  by setting the PCP_DISABLE_TIME_SCALING_BY_LAYER_TCPS environment variable,
  but we expect to remove this in a future release.

- Significant changes and additions to value clips functionality. See
  documentation for more details:
  - Added support for jump discontinuities in clip times metadata to encode
    looping behaviors.

    in clips. The manifest will be generated in-memory at runtime if one
    hasn't been specified.
  - Value resolution will no longer fall through to weaker layers if a clip
    does not have values for an attribute declared in the manifest. In these
    cases, the value may come from the default value authored in the manifest
    or (optionally) be interpolated from surrounding clips.
  - Removed support for legacy value clips metadata.

  Windows. (Issue: [#921](https://www.github.com/PixarAnimationStudios/USD/issues/921))
- Fixed issue where build_usd.py would fail to build TBB on MacOS if CUDA was
  installed due to an issue in the TBB build system. 
  (Issue: [#767](https://www.github.com/PixarAnimationStudios/USD/issues/767))
- Made PXR_VERSION a valid and comparable integer in C++. 
  (PR: [#886](https://www.github.com/PixarAnimationStudios/USD/pull/886))

  of SDF_TEXTFILE_SIZE_WARNING_MB environment variable. 
  (PR: [#980](https://www.github.com/PixarAnimationStudios/USD/pull/980))
- Added UsdStageLoadRules to support more robust and declarative intent about
  how payloads should be included in a UsdStage.
- Added UsdPrimCompositionQuery to facilitate discovery of composition arcs
  affecting a UsdPrim.

- Added "timecode" scene description value type. This type is represented by
  the SdfTimeCode class and can be used for attribute and metadata values.
  Layer offsets are applied to all timecode values during UsdStage
  value resolution, enabling "timing curve"-like attributes.

- Added support for Google's Draco compression library. This includes an
  SdfFileFormat plugin for reading .drc files and a standalone "usdcompress"
  tool that extracts and compress Mesh primitives from a USD file, creates
  .drc files for each one, and references them back into a result USD file.
  (PR: [#912](https://www.github.com/PixarAnimationStudios/USD/pull/912))

- Added --quiet flag to usdGenSchema for suppressing output. 
  (PR: [#480](https://www.github.com/PixarAnimationStudios/USD/pull/480))

  UsdGeomPointInstancer::ComputeInstanceTransformAtTime(s) to account for
  authored accelerations, if present.

- Added "accelerations" attribute to UsdGeomPointBased schema and added
  UsdGeomPointBased::ComputePointsAtTime(s) to compute point positions using
  authored velocities and accelerations, if present.

- Added initial version of UsdRender domain and schemas. See documentation and
  white paper on openusd.org for more details. 
  (Issue: [#910](https://www.github.com/PixarAnimationStudios/USD/issues/910))
- Added UsdShadeInput::GetValueProducingAttribute to facilitate more robust and
  correct processing of UsdShade shading networks.
- Added initial support for skinning mesh normals in UsdSkel.

- Removed SdfAbstractDataSpecId and updated the SdfAbstractData interface to
  use SdfPath in its place. Existing SdfAbstractData subclasses must be
  updated to match. See this usd-interest post for more details:
      https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/usd-interest/IVmd1t1GKBA

- Numerous fixes for C++14 / gcc6 warnings. 
  (PR: [#869](https://www.github.com/PixarAnimationStudios/USD/pull/869))
- Various optimizations and cleanups in trace library.

- Inherits and specializes arcs that target root prims ("global" arcs) are now
  combined with arcs that target sub-root prims ("local" arcs) for strength
  ordering in composition. Previously, local arcs would always be considered
  stronger than global arcs regardless of their authored order.

- Calling UsdReferences::SetReferences (and equivalent API on UsdPayloads,
  UsdInherits, and UsdSpecializes) with an empty vector now authors an
  explicit empty list op instead of being a no-op. 
  (Issue: [#749](https://www.github.com/PixarAnimationStudios/USD/issues/749))

- Numerous fixes and changes to Sdr and associated parser plugins. This
  includes the addition of a "terminal" property type and "role" and
  "renderType" metadata to better describe shader properties and their
  representation in scene description.

- Numerous optimizations for UsdStage load time and authoring speed.
- Improved performance of adding empty sublayers to an existing UsdStage.

- USD native instancing now includes both LoadRules and PopulationMasks in
  instancing keys, so different instances can have different load state.
  Instances that have equivalent load rules and population masks still share,
  but those that do not will use different masters.

- Load/Unload operations on a UsdStage now must operate on the "expanded" stage
  namespace. That is, the namespace as it would be if instancing was disabled.
- Updated UsdLuxDomeLight schema to clarify a dome light's orientation and
  its textures' orientation. 
  (Issue: [#938](https://www.github.com/PixarAnimationStudios/USD/issues/938))
- Changed 'pointIndices' attribute on UsdSkelBlendShape schema from uint[]
  to int[] for consistency with other core schemas. 
  (Issue: [#858](https://www.github.com/PixarAnimationStudios/USD/issues/858))
- Rewrote UsdSkelBakeSkinning to provide a more efficient baking solution.
- Fixed bug where converting .usdc files from version 0.7 to 0.8 when saving
  an existing file would produce incorrect layer offsets in payloads.
- Fixed crashes when calling methods on invalid Usd.SchemaBase objects in
  Python.

### Maya Plugin
- Deprecated Maya plugin in favor of the Autodesk maya-usd plugin available at
  https://github.com/Autodesk/maya-usd. We anticipate removing the plugin from
  the USD repository in the next release and recommend users begin transitioning
  to the Autodesk plugin -- it contains the same features as the Pixar plugin
  (in fact, it is the same code).

- FindMaya.cmake module on MacOS (once again) supports paths that include the
  "Maya.app/Contents" subdirectory when specifying MAYA_LOCATION. 
  (PR: [#878](https://www.github.com/PixarAnimationStudios/USD/pull/878))

  procedurally generate a layer using metadata authored on the prim where the
  layer is introduced via a payload arc. See examples and "Advanced Features"
  documentation for more details.
- Fixed erroneous composition cycle detection for subroot references to
  sibling prims across reference boundaries.

  command-line flag.
- UsdGeomBasisCurves schema now accepts "pinned" as a valid value for
  wrapping to represent pinned curves.
- UsdGeomPointInstancer will now use the "append" list op when authoring
  inactiveIds metadata instead of the deprecated "added" list op. This
  behavior can be reverted by setting the environment variable
  `USDGEOM_POINTINSTANCER_NEW_APPLYOPS` to 0, but this will be removed
  in a future release.
- Added UsdShadeCoordSysAPI schema for representing coordinate systems.
- Added shaping:ies:normalize attribute to UsdLuxShapingAPI.

  "defaultPrim" prim path.
- Miscellaneous improvements for converting between UsdSkel and Agent
  primitives.

### Katana Plugin:
- Added support for reading and resolving collection-based material bindings to
  PxrUsdIn. This is done as a two stage process in which bindings (for the
  purposes specified in "additionalBindingPurposeNames") are added within a
  "usd.materialBindings" group attribute. The PxrUsdInResolveMaterialBindings
  node (and its corresponding Op) transfers a purpose's binding to the
  system-level "materialAssign" attribute and optionally filters inherited
  redundancy.
- The "info.usd" attributes which advertise which API schemas are applied can
  be created in either array or group attribute form. The latter is convenient
  to match against via CEL.

### Maya Plugin:
- Add support for exporting assembly edits on pxrUsdReferenceAssembly nodes.

  now provide the same set of features as references.

  This may affect backwards compatibility of layers written with this version
  of USD:
  - Layers containing payloads using these new features will not be readable
    in previous USD versions. .usdc files containing these payloads will be
    marked as version 0.8.0.

## [18.09] - 2018-08-07

This release includes several major new features and changes, including:
  - .usdz file format for packaging assets into a single file
  - Introduction of UsdPreviewSurface
  - Switch to calendar-based versioning scheme for USD libraries

### Added
- Build:
  - build_usd.py can be given custom arguments for building libraries via the
    `--build-args` option.
  - Option to disable building usdview by specifying `PXR_BUILD_USDVIEW=OFF` 
    when running cmake or `--no-usdview` when running build_usd.py.
  - Allow specifying `Boost_USE_STATIC_LIBS` to cmake on Windows. Note that 
    static boost libraries may lead to issues with Python bindings. 
    (Issue: [#407](https://www.github.com/PixarAnimationStudios/USD/issues/407))

- USD:
  - ArAsset and ArResolver::OpenAsset interfaces allowing resolvers to control
    how data for a given asset is accessed.
  - "Package" asset and layer concepts to Ar and Sdf, including 
    "package-relative" asset path syntax for addressing assets within packages.
  - sdffilter utility for inspecting and summarizing the contents of a layer.
  - .usdz file format. This format allows multiple assets (including layers, 
    textures, etc.) to be packaged into a single file that can be consumed by
    USD without being unpacked to disk. These files can be created via the 
    "usdzip" command-line utility or via APIs like UsdZipFileWriter and 
    UsdUtilsCreateNewUsdzPackage.
  - UsdStage::GetObjectAtPath for retrieving a generic UsdObject. 
    (PR: [#390](https://www.github.com/PixarAnimationStudios/USD/pull/390))
  - UsdCollectionAPI can represent collections that include all paths or exclude
    some paths but include all others via the new "includeRoot" attribute.
  - Support for "sourceAsset" and "sourceCode" implementation sources in 
    UsdShadeShader.
  - Ndr and Sdr libraries that provide a registry for shader definitions that 
    can be extended via plugins.
  - sdrOsl plugin for populating shader definition registry from OSL 1.8.12. 
    OSL support must be enabled by specifying `PXR_ENABLE_OSL_SUPPORT=TRUE` 
    when running cmake.
  - usdMtlx plugin containing USD file format and shader definition registry 
    plugins based on MaterialX 1.36.0. MaterialX support must be enabled by
    specifying `PXR_BUILD_MATERIALX_PLUGIN=TRUE` when running cmake.
  - Initial UsdSkel schema for blend shapes, which are not yet factored into
    computed deformation.

- Imaging:
  - Per-prim adaptive refinement enabled via materials in hdSt.
  - Preliminary AOV support in Hydra with sample implementation in Embree 
    plugin.
  - HdRenderThread utility class to enable render delegates to render in 
    background threads. The Embree plugin uses this class as an example.
  - Support for scene-authored normals on meshes.

- UsdImaging:
  - Light linking support.
  - Initial support for USD material preview nodes. For more details, see:
    http://graphics.pixar.com/usd/docs/UsdPreviewSurface-Proposal.html 

    Currently unimplemented features include:
    - Support for automatically computed tangents when normal mapping. Primvars
      must be supplied.
    - Handling for ior (index or refraction).

- Alembic plugin:
  - Support for TextureCoordinate role and value types.

- Maya plugin:
  - Initial support for exporting .usdz files.
  - Support for importing and exporting volume and displacement in "pxrRis"
    shading mode.
  - pxrUsdPointBasedDeformerNode - an animation cache deformer that allows users
    to pose a Maya mesh based on a UsdGeomPointBased prim.
  - Option to apply Euler filtering to transforms during export. 
    (PR: [#299](https://www.github.com/PixarAnimationStudios/USD/pull/299))
  - Option to filter out certain Maya node types during export. 
    (PR: [#475](https://www.github.com/PixarAnimationStudios/USD/pull/475))

- Katana plugin:
  - Support for TextureCoordinate role and value types.
  - Support for importing inherit paths metadata as a info.usd group attribute
  - "additionalLocations" parameter to PxrUsdInVariantSelect
  - "asArchive" option to PxrUsdIn. When enabled, a "usd archive" location will 
    be created rather than loading the USD data directly. This is intended for 
    passing along to renderers which support reading USD natively.
  - PxrUsdIn supports a "sharedLooksCacheKey" attribute to permit sharing cached
    USD shading information across multiple references/instances which are known
    to be identical from a pipeline standpoint.

- Houdini plugin:
  - Support import of Scope prims.

### Changed
- Build:
  - USD resource files are now installed into <prefix>/lib/usd instead of
    <prefix>/share/usd/plugins to bring them closer to the installed libraries.
  - OpenGL dependency in imaging is now optional and may be disabled by 
    specifying `PXR_ENABLE_GL_SUPPORT=FALSE` when running cmake. This will 
    disable all GL-based functionality, including usdview.
  - OpenImageIO dependency imaging is now optional and is disabled by default. 
    Support must be enabled by specifying `PXR_BUILD_OPENIMAGEIO_PLUGIN=TRUE`
    when running CMake or `--openimageio` when running build_usd.py.
  - build_usd.py on Windows will now use powershell to download dependencies
    if it's available to avoid TLS 1.2 issues. 
    (Issue: [#449](https://www.github.com/PixarAnimationStudios/USD/issues/449))
  - build_usd.py now directs users to install PySide2 via pip on MacOS.

- USD:
  - Numerous fixes and cleanup changes throughout to improve performance, 
    convert code to more modern patterns, and remove unneeded uses of boost.
  - ArGetResolver no longer returns an instance of the ArResolver subclass used
    for asset resolution. Clients can use ArGetUnderlyingResolver in the special
    cases where access to the exact subclass is necessary.
  - ArResolver context and scoped cache functions are now public and have been
    renamed to match convention. Resolvers that override these functions will 
    need to be updated.
  - ArDefaultResolver default context for an asset now includes the directory
    of the asset in its search path.
  - Optimizations to prim change processing in UsdStage. In one example, 
    processing time for adding new prims decreased ~50%.
  - New .usdc files now default to version 0.7.0, which includes compression
    features introduced in earlier releases. These files cannot be read in USD
    releases prior to v0.8.4. Users can revert to writing older versions by
    setting the environment variable `USD_WRITE_NEW_USDC_FILES_AS_VERSION`
    to an older version.
  - Several changes to provide cleaner and more detailed runtime error messages.
  - Better support for generating code for properties of multiple-apply API
    schemas in usdGenSchema.
  - Schema types are now specified using the UsdSchemaType enum instead of 
    individual flags.
  - "expansionRule" attribute for UsdCollectionAPI is now optional; collections
    are created simply by calling UsdCollectionAPI::ApplyCollection.
  - UsdGeomBBoxCache's bounds computation now includes all defined prims,
    including those with no type specified.
  - UsdRiMaterialAPI now writes standardized "ri:surface" output by default 
    instead of deprecated "ri:bxdf".
  - UsdRiStatementsAPI now writes ri attributes as primvars by default.
  - Renamed UsdSkelPackedJointAnimation schema to UsdSkelAnimation
  - Renamed UsdSkelBakingSkinningLBS function to UsdSkelBakeSkinning
  - Numerous additional fixes and changes to UsdSkel schemas and APIs.

- Imaging:
  - Several API cleanup changes in HdSprim/HdBprim/HdRprim.
  - HdRenderDelegate::CanComputeMaterialNetworks has been replaced by
    GetMaterialBindingPurpose, which has a default value of "preview".
  - Improved handling of fallback texturing behavior when texture inputs are
    missing from a material.
  - .png, .jpg, .bmp, .tga, and .hdr images are now handled by a built-in
    image reader based on stb_image.
  - Texture loading is deferred until needed.
  - Truncate mesh vertex primvar data to expected length if larger than expected.
  - Improved ptex rect packing performance. In one large test case, processing
    time decreased from ~600s to ~40s.

- UsdImaging:
  - Avoid loading custom shaders and textures when the "Enable Hardware Shading"
    option is disabled in usdview.
  - Default values for wrapS/wrapT match the proposed value in the preview
    material spec. Also adds support for mirrored wrapS/wrapT.
  - Scene lights are now enabled by default. This can be disabled by setting
    the environment variable `USDIMAGING_ENABLE_SCENE_LIGHTS` to 0.
  - UsdShadeMaterialAPI is now used instead of UsdRi to look up material 
    networks.

- Alembic plugin:
  - Alembic writer now prefers writing to the "st" attribute instead of "uv". 
    (PR: [#463](https://www.github.com/PixarAnimationStudios/USD/pull/463))

- Maya plugin:
  - MAYA_SCRIPT_PATH and XBMLANGPATH environment variable settings have changed
    due to new resource file install location documented above. Refer to Maya
    plugin documentation for new values.
  - Large refactoring and cleanup of usdMaya. USD importers and exporters for
    built-in Maya nodes have been moved to pxrUsdTranslators plugin.
  - Proxy shape now redraws in response to changes on UsdStage.
  - Diagnostic messages are now batched together for better reporting behavior
    and to prevent log spewage.

    (PR: [#330](https://www.github.com/PixarAnimationStudios/USD/pull/330))
  - Camera shake now applied to USD cameras on export. 
    (PR: [#366](https://www.github.com/PixarAnimationStudios/USD/pull/366))

### Deprecated
- USD:
  - UsdSkelPackedJointAnimation schema in favor of UsdSkelAnimation

- Simplified API for setting layer data in SdfFileFormat subclasses.
- Adding or removing invalid sublayers now results in composition errors.
- UsdStage::CreateNew and CreateInMemory now accept an InitialLoadSet argument.
  This controls whether new payloads are loaded automatically. 
  (Issue: [#267](https://www.github.com/PixarAnimationStudios/USD/issues/267))
- UsdStage::ExpandPopulationMask now considers attribute connections.
- UsdStage::Flatten now authors anchored asset paths in flattened results.
- UsdTraverseInstanceProxies() now includes instance proxy prims that pass the
  default predicate instead of all prims.
- .usdc files now support zero-copy array access, which can significantly
  improve performance. This feature is supported by all .usdc file
  versions, but may not be activated for certain files depending on their
  data alignment. In these cases, users can simply re-export the file 
  to activate zero-copy access.

  Users can set the environment variable `USDC_ENABLE_ZERO_COPY_ARRAYS` to 0 
  to disable this feature. Users can also track cases where array data is 
  copied due to modifications by setting the environment variable
  `VT_LOG_STACK_ON_ARRAY_DETACH_COPY` to 1.
- Other performance improvements in UsdStage composition.
- API schemas are now classified as either "applied" or "non-applied". See
  "Generating New Schema Classes" tutorial for more information.

  material bindings if prims with old "look:binding" relationships are found.
  This can be disabled by setting the environment variable 
  `USD_SHADE_WARN_ON_LOOK_BINDING` to 0.
- UsdRiMaterialAPI now supports writing ri:surface outputs. ri:bxdf outputs are
  still written by default, but this can be disabled by setting the environment
  variable `USD_RI_WRITE_BXDF_OUTPUT` to 0.
- UsdRiStatementsAPI now supports encoding ri attibutes as primvars. This is
  disabled by default but can be enabled by setting the environment variable 
  `USDRI_STATEMENTS_WRITE_NEW_ATTR_ENCODING` to 1.

  This can be enabled by setting the `USD_KATANA_ALLOW_CUSTOM_MATERIAL_SCOPES`
  environment variable to 1.
- Refactor material loading in Katana plugin so that material locations aren't 
  computed all at once and site ops can run on each location individually.
- Improved construction of material terminal outputs in Katana plugin.
- Caching improvements in Houdini plugin to share USD stages between loaded
  primitives when possible.
- Improved error handling and reporting in Houdini plugin.
- USD stage masking in Houdini plugin can now be disabled via 
  `GUSD_STAGEMASK_ENABLE` environment variable.

  be returned by UsdRiMaterialAPI::GetSurface for backwards compatibility.

### Fixed
- Build errors when using ninja.
- Error when extracting boost on Windows in build_usd.py. 
  (Issue: [#308](https://www.github.com/PixarAnimationStudios/USD/issues/308))

- Updated moduleDeps.cpp files to only register direct library dependencies.
  This makes it easier for users to generate their own file for custom schemas.
- ArDefaultResolver now allows search paths like "Dir/File.usd" to be anchored 
  to other paths via AnchorRelativePath. During composition, these asset paths 
  will be resolved relative to the layer where they were authored before
  falling back to the previous search path behavior.
- Updates to VtArray and .usdc code in preparation for zero-copy functionality.
- Inherit and specializes arcs to non-existent prims are no longer considered
  composition errors.

  when sources were outside the scope of the point instancer. 
  (Issue: [#286](https://www.github.com/PixarAnimationStudios/USD/issues/286))

## [0.8.3] - 2018-02-05

### Added
- Compression in .usdc files for integer arrays and scalar floating point 
  arrays. The latter are compressed if the values are all integers or there 
  are a small number of unique values. In the example Kitchen Set asset on 
  the USD website, the total size of the geometry layers decreased by ~46%, 
  from 25 MB to 14 MB.

  .usdc files with this new compression enabled are marked as version 0.6.0
  and are not readable by earlier releases. These files are not written by
  default; this may be enabled by setting the environment variable 
  `USD_WRITE_NEW_USDC_FILES_AS_VERSION` to "0.6.0".
- Ability to record and query API schemas that have been applied to a prim
  via new Apply method on API schema classes, UsdPrim::GetAppliedSchemas and

  materials to prims or collections of prims and computing the final bound
  material for a prim via "material resolution".
- Numerous features and documentation for UsdSkel schema.
- "Save Flattened As" functionality in usdview.
- Plugin mechanism in usdview that allows users to add custom commands 
  and menus. See new tutorial for more details.
- Partial support for RenderMan for Maya lights in the Maya plugin.
- PxrUsdIn.BootstrapMaterialGroup op in Katana plugin for more robustly reading 
  a Looks scope from a .usd file

### Changed
- Build now supports versioned OpenEXR and IlmBase shared libraries. 
  (Issue: [#71](https://www.github.com/PixarAnimationStudios/USD/issues/71))
- Layer identifiers may now include '?' characters. 
  (Issue: [#289](https://www.github.com/PixarAnimationStudios/USD/issues/289))
- UsdStage preserves payload load state when processing instancing changes.
- UsdListPosition enum values now specify the "append" or "prepend" list as 
  well as a position to provide users with finer-grained control.
- The various Add... methods in Usd that take a UsdListPosition argument
  now author entries to the back of the "prepend" list by default if no
  "explicit" list exists. The old behavior of authoring to the (now 
  deprecated) "added" list can be restored by setting the environment
  variable `USD_AUTHOR_OLD_STYLE_ADD` to 1.
- Standard schema conventions are more strictly-enforced in usdGenSchema.
- UsdCollectionAPI::AddCollection has been renamed ApplyCollection.
- Enabled authoring of new UsdShade encoding by default. Authoring the old
  (now deprecated) encoding can be restored by setting the environment variable 
  `USD_SHADE_WRITE_NEW_ENCODING` to 0.
- The "joints" relationship on the UsdSkelSkeleton, UsdSkelPackedJointAnimation,
  and UsdSkelBinding API schemas is now a token array-valued attribute.

  be authored to the location where a "setOpArgsToInfo" attribute exists and is
  set to 1.

### Deprecated
- The "added" list for list ops in scene description is deprecated in favor 
  of the "prepend" and "append" lists.

### Removed
- GfCamera::ZUp and GfCamera::YUp.
- UsdSkelJoint schema.

### Fixed
- build_usd.py ensures OpenImageIO build does not pick up OpenEXR from other 
  locations, which could have led to runtime errors. 
  (Issue: [#315](https://www.github.com/PixarAnimationStudios/USD/issues/315), 
  Issue: [#325](https://www.github.com/PixarAnimationStudios/USD/issues/325))
- Headers are now installed properly for monolithic builds. 
  (Issue: [#277](https://www.github.com/PixarAnimationStudios/USD/issues/277))

  relocating builds. 
  (Issue: [#363](https://www.github.com/PixarAnimationStudios/USD/issues/363))
- Fixed thread-safety issue where plugins with the same name but in different
  locations could be loaded twice. 
  (Issue: [#358](https://www.github.com/PixarAnimationStudios/USD/issues/358))

  they were first opened could not be unmuted.
- Fixed bug in usdGenSchema where changing an existing property's type in a 
  schema would not be reflected in the generated code.
- Fixed bug where a large (> 1460) number of variants in a .usda file would
  cause a "memory exhausted" error when parsing that file.
- Fixed broken pread mode for .usdc files.
- Fixed bug that caused UsdStage::CreateNew to crash on Windows. 
  (Issue: [#364](https://www.github.com/PixarAnimationStudios/USD/issues/364))
- Fixed bug when using a UsdStagePopulationMask with prims beneath instances. 
  (Issue: [#312](https://www.github.com/PixarAnimationStudios/USD/issues/312))
- Fixed bug where setting float-valued attributes to +inf in Python would fail.
- UsdAttribute::GetTimeSamplesInInterval now properly accounts for layer 
  offsets. (Issue: [#352](https://www.github.com/PixarAnimationStudios/USD/issues/352))
- Internal references or empty asset paths no longer cause errors in 
  UsdUtilsFlattenLayerStack.
- Fixed bug where UsdGeomPrimvar::GetTimeSamples would miss time samples for
  indexed primvars.
- Disabled tiny prim culling in Hydra by default. It can be re-enabled by
  setting the environment variable `HD_ENABLE_TINY_PRIM_CULLING` to 1.
  (Issue: [#314](https://www.github.com/PixarAnimationStudios/USD/issues/314))
- Fixed issues with using non-file-backed asset paths in various utilities
  and Maya and Katana plugins.
- Houdini plugin explicitly links against required libraries to avoid runtime
  errors with Houdini 16.5.

## [0.8.2] - 2017-12-01

Release 0.8.2 increments the file format version for .usdc files. New .usdc
files created in this release will not be readable by earlier releases. See
below for more details.

### Added
- SdfCopySpec for copying scene description specs in layers.
- Usd.GetVersion() for retrieving USD version in Python 
  (Issue: [#306](https://www.github.com/PixarAnimationStudios/USD/issues/306))
- UsdProperty::FlattenTo for copying a UsdProperty's resolved metadata/values.
- IsTyped and IsConcrete schema queries on UsdSchemaRegistry and UsdSchemaBase. 
- UsdCollectionAPI schema for representing collections of objects. This schema
  is more expressive than UsdGeomCollectionAPI and can represent large numbers
  of objects compactly.
- Utility functions in UsdUtils for determining compact representations of
  objects for UsdCollectionAPI.
- UsdUtilsCoalescingDiagnosticDelegate, a Tf diagnostic delegate that provides
  condensed output for diagnostic messages.
- UsdUtilsFlattenLayerStack for flattening a UsdStage's layer stack into a
  single layer, as well as a --flattenLayerStack option to usdcat.
- Support for named clip sets for clip stitching API in UsdUtils.
- Schema for cards rendering in UsdGeomModelAPI and imaging support. This
  provides a lightweight way to collapse model hierarchies into simple
  geometry for visualization of large scenes.
- Ability to encode familyType on owners of families of UsdGeomSubsets.
- Size properties for UsdLuxDiskLight, UsdLuxSphereLight, and UsdLuxRectLight. 
  (Issue: [#290](https://www.github.com/PixarAnimationStudios/USD/issues/290))
- Support for computing bounding boxes for UsdGeomPointInstancer instances 
  using UsdGeomBBoxCache.
- Support for residual GPU computations in Hydra.
- Sheer display mode in Hydra, a 'see-through' display mode akin to the
  mesh being covered in a sheer mesh fabric instead of its regular surface.
  Implemented as a regular grid stipple pattern of the surface at 20% opacity.
- Testing framework for usdview.
- PxrUsdMayaXformStack for representing transform stacks in the Maya plugin.
- Support for exporting Maya instancers to UsdGeomPointInstancers in the Maya
  plugin.
- Support for exporting groups of objects with the same material binding as
  collections encoded with UsdCollectionAPI in the Maya plugin.
- Support for vec4 primvars in the Katana plugin.
- Support for point instancers with varying topology that don't have authored 
  velocities in the Katana plugin.
- Support for importing collections encoded with new UsdCollectionAPI schema
  in the Katana plugin.
- Support for overriding data on a subset of point instancer instances in
  the Houdini plugin.

### Changed
- Build system now checks that the compiler being used supports 64-bit builds. 
- Tf diagnostic warnings and status messages issued in secondary threads are
  no longer printed to the terminal.
- Multiple delegates may now be registered with the Tf diagnostic system.
- SdfLayer::RemoveInertSceneDescription removes inert overs in variants.
- When saving a new .usdc file over an existing file, data is first saved to a 
  temporary file then renamed to the destination file. This provides some 
  protection for other processes that were reading the old file.
- Compression for structural sections in .usdc files is now enabled by default.
  New .usdc files will be marked as version 0.4.0 instead of 0.3.0 to 
  accommodate a bug fix described below. This means that any new .usdc files 
  created in this release will not be readable by previous USD releases.

  Users can disable the compression functionality by setting the environment
  variable `USD_WRITE_NEW_USDC_FILES_AS_VERSION` to "0.0.1". This will ensure 
  new .usdc files will be readable in older releases.

- UsdStage now uses the composed layer offset instead of its inverse when
  mapping times in layers to the stage. For example, to shift the time samples
  in a referenced layer stack forward by 10, users previously authored an
  offset of -10. Under the new behavior, users need to author an offset of 10
  instead. 

  Users can revert to the old behavior by setting the environment variable
  `USD_USE_INVERSE_LAYER_OFFSET` to 1. This will be deprecated in a future 
  release.

- UsdStage now allows a prim to be loaded without loading its descendants via
  a new UsdLoadPolicy argument supplied to UsdStage::Load and LoadAndUnload.
- UsdInherits, UsdSpecializes, and UsdReferences now map non-root prim paths
  to the namespace of the edit target.
- UsdAttribute::GetTimeSamplesInInterval now supports open/finite end points.
- UsdClipsAPI now authors the dictionary-style clips metadata introduced in
  release 0.7.6 by default.
- Schemas may now define fallback values for the majority of metadata fields,
  including custom metadata fields.
- Schemas may now have more than 256 tokens defined.
- usdedit now checks `USD_EDITOR` environment variable first when determining
  which editor to use.
- Ongoing refactoring to move code from hd to hdSt in preparation for material
  support in Hydra and use of Hydra in other renderer backends.
- Several performance optimizations in Hydra and UsdImaging.
- usdview now uses a new JSON-based format for its settings file. Settings
  files from older releases will be ignored.
- Several changes to provide better support for Viewport 2.0 in Maya plugin.
- Enum attributes in Maya now have their integer values exported to USD 
  instead of their descriptive names.
- Improved attribute transfer on USD Unpack node in Houdini plugin.
- usdvisible and usdactive attributes in Houdini plugin are now integers
  instead of strings.
- Several changes to Houdini plugin for compatibility with Houdini 16.5
  and improved HDK usage.

### Deprecated
- UsdGeomCollectionAPI, in favor of new UsdCollectionAPI.

### Removed
- TfDiagnosticNotice. The Tf diagnostic system no longer emits notices; 
  consumers relying on these notices should use diagnostic delegates instead.
- UsdGeomPointInstancer prototypeDrawMode attribute. Consumers should use
  the new drawMode attributes on UsdGeomModelAPI instead.

### Fixed
- Issue where users were forced to define certain preprocessor macros in 
  order to build code against USD. In particular, an issue introduced in 0.8.1
  caused users who did not #define PXR_ENABLE_PYTHON_SUPPORT to run into odd
  errors at runtime. 
  (Issue: [#304](https://www.github.com/PixarAnimationStudios/USD/issues/304))
- Bug that caused invalid .usdc files to be written. This affected all files
  with version 0.3.0; however, this file version was not enabled by default in
  release 0.8.1 and would only affect users who had explicitly enabled the
  new version via the `USD_WRITE_NEW_USDC_FILES_AS_VERSION` environment setting.
- Precision loss when writing time sample times to .usda files.
- Performance issue in UsdStage where memory would still be consumed by 
  child prims after their parent prim had been deactivated.
- Bug that caused UsdStage::ExpandPopulationMask to add invalid paths.
- Bug that caused UsdObject::GetMetadata to not fill in resolved paths for
  asset-valued metadata.
- Bug where layer offsets were incorrectly applied when authoring time samples.
- Bug in UsdUtilsStageCache that led to crashes during static destruction.
- Unpickable objects now act as occluders during picking in Hydra.
- Bug that caused usdview to stop drawing after "Reopen Stage" or "Open Stage".
- Bug that caused usdview to not play all frames if the step size was changed.
  (Issue: [#321](https://www.github.com/PixarAnimationStudios/USD/issues/321))
- Several performance and UI issues in usdview.
- Crash in Maya plugin with nested assemblies and variant set selections.
  (Issue: [#288](https://www.github.com/PixarAnimationStudios/USD/issues/288))
- Bug in Maya plugin where exporting over a previously-imported layer failed.
- Bug in Maya plugin that caused lights to flip between directional and 
  non-directional in legacy viewport.
- Various issues that prevented UsdKatana Python module from being imported.
  (Issue: [#323](https://www.github.com/PixarAnimationStudios/USD/issues/323))
- Material bindings above point instancer prototypes are now preserved in 
  the Katana plugin.
- Reworked how USD masters/sources are built in the Katana plugin so 
  that material bindings use the correct Katana paths.
- Hang in Houdini plugin when importing from variant paths. 
  (Issue: [#309](https://www.github.com/PixarAnimationStudios/USD/issues/309))

## [0.8.1] - 2017-10-02

### Added
- "append" and "prepend" operations for SdfListOp-valued fields.
  Scene description layers that contain these new operations will not be
  readable by earlier USD releases.
- `--validate` argument to sdfdump for checking file validity.
- Support for sub-root references and payloads.
- Ability to specify amount of data to prefetch when reading a .usdc
  file via the `USDC_MMAP_PREFETCH_KB` environment variable.
- Debugging output that shows memory mapping information for .usdc files.
  This can be enabled via the `USDC_DUMP_PAGE_MAPS` environment variable.
- UsdGeomMotionAPI schema.
- UsdGeomSubset schema for representing a subset of a geometric prim.
- Hydra GL support for displacement shaders
- Initial experimental support for PySide2 in usdview. By default, the 
  build will search for PySide, then PySide2. Alternatively, users may specify 
  `PYSIDE_USE_PYSIDE2=TRUE` to CMake to force the use of PySide2.
- Ability to view connections and relationship targets in usdview.
- Support for camera clipping range in Alembic plugin.
- Support for array attributes with "RfM Shaders" shading mode in Maya exporter.
- Support for angularVelocities attribute on point instancers in Katana plugin.
- Filtered view and improved selection to Tree View panel in Houdini plugin.
- Support for prototype offsets in point instancer exports in Houdini plugin.

### Changed
- Made Python dependency optional. Python support is enabled by default but
  may be disabled by specifying `PXR_ENABLE_PYTHON_SUPPORT=FALSE` to CMake
  or `--no-python` to build_usd.py.
- build_usd.py now requires that users install PyOpenGL manually. 
  (Issue: [#264](https://www.github.com/PixarAnimationStudios/USD/issues/264))
- Replaced addedOrExplicitItems attribute on Sdf.*ListOp in Python with
  GetAddedOrExplicitItems method.
- Renamed Append... methods on composition arc APIs (e.g. UsdReferences, 
  UsdInherits) to Add... and added a position argument to support new
  "append" and "prepend" operations. 

  Calling these functions with the default UsdListPositionTempDefault argument
  will author "add" operations, maintaining the previous behavior. We anticipate
  removing UsdListPositionTempDefault and replacing it with UsdListPositionFront
  so that "prepend" operations will be authored by default in 0.8.2. Users may 
  enable this behavior now by setting the `USD_AUTHOR_OLD_STYLE_ADD` environment
  variable to false.

- UsdStage now issues warnings for invalid layers it encounters instead of
  errors, which cause exceptions in Python.
- Code generation templates and schema.usda files used by usdGenSchema are 
  now installed as part of the build. Schemas can now use asset paths like
  "usdGeom/schema.usda" or "usdShade/schema.usda" instead of absolute paths
  to add installed schemas as sublayers. 
  (Issue: [#158](https://www.github.com/PixarAnimationStudios/USD/issues/158), 
   Issue: [#211](https://www.github.com/PixarAnimationStudios/USD/issues/211))
- Improved USD scenegraph instancing to allow more sharing of assets with
  inherits or specializes arcs. In one large example, this decreased stage load
  time by ~60%, stage memory usage by ~65%, and time to first image in usdview 
  by ~20%.
- Several optimizations to reduce I/O operations for .usda and .usdc files.
- Add support for compressed structural sections in .usdc files. This can
  significantly decrease file sizes for files that are dominated by prim and
  property hierarchy; one production shading file decreased in size by ~94%,
  from 21 MB to 1.3 MB.

  Compressed files are marked as version 0.3.0 and are not readable by earlier 
  USD releases. To help with transition, USD will not write these compressed 
  files by default until a future release. Users may enable this feature now 
  by setting the `USD_WRITE_NEW_USDC_FILES_AS_VERSION` environment variable 
  to "0.3.0". We plan to add compression for geometry data and time samples
  in a future release.

- UsdUtilsExtractExternalReferences now checks for references to external files
  in property values and metadata.

  system can be specified on a UsdStage (via the stage's root layer), and 
  colorSpace metadata is available on any UsdAttribute.
- Added clip set functionality to Usd. This provides the ability to specify 
  multiple sets of value clips on the same prim, which allows users to compose 
  different sets of clips together. See UsdClipsAPI for more details.
- Added initial UsdLux schemas for representing interchangeable lights and 
  related concepts, and UsdRi schemas for Renderman-specific extensions. 
  UsdImaging/Hydra support will be coming in a future release.
- Added ability to specify smooth triangle subdivision scheme for catmullClark
  surfaces in UsdGeomMesh and imaging support in Hydra.
- Added backdrops for node layout description in UsdUI.
- Added support for sharing immutable primvar buffers to Hydra.
  This can greatly reduce the memory required on the GPU when displaying

  default but may be disabled by specifying `PXR_ENABLE_HDF5_SUPPORT=FALSE`
  to CMake.
- Metadata fields for value clips feature in UsdStage (e.g. clipAssetPaths,
  clipTimes, etc.) have been deprecated in favor of the new clips metadata
  dictionary. Authoring APIs on UsdClipsAPI still write out the deprecated
  metadata unless the environment variable `USD_AUTHOR_LEGACY_CLIPS` is set 
  to 0. This will be disabled in a future release.
- When using value clips, Usd will now report time samples at each time 
  authored in the clip times metadata.
- Completed support for encoding UsdShade data using UsdAttribute connections.
  Authoring APIs still write out the old encoding, unless the environment 
  variable `USD_SHADE_WRITE_NEW_ENCODING` is set to 1. This will be enabled

  directories rather than the source directories.
- Fixed race condition in TfType.
- Fixed long-standing memory corruption bug in Pcp that surfaced when 
  building on MacOS with XCode 8.3.2.

  configured with the `PXR_ENABLE_PRECOMPILED_HEADERS` CMake option.  
- Added many unit tests for core libraries
- Added UsdStage::Save and UsdStage::SaveSessionLayers
- Added attribute connection feature that allows consumers to describe
  connections between an attribute and other prims and properties.
- Added instance proxy feature that allows consumers to interact with
  objects on a UsdStage as if scenegraph instancing were not in use while
  retaining the performance benefits of instancing.
- Plugins providing Boundable schema types can now register functions for
  computing extents. This allows code in the USD core to compute extents for
  prims with types provided by external schemas.
- Added support for specializes arcs to usdShade.

- Cleaned up and expanded doxygen documentation:
  - Added documentation for value clips and scenegraph instancing USD features.
  - Enabled XML generation for external tools
  - Fixed invalid tags and formatting in several places
- UsdTreeIterator has been replaced by UsdPrimRange, which provides 
  container-like semantics in C++ (e.g., the ability to use them in range-based
  for loops).
- Removed UsdPrim::GetPayload API
- UsdRelationship and UsdAttribute will no longer forward target/connection
  paths that point to objects within instances to objects in master prims.
  Users can use the new instance proxy functionality to work with these paths
  instead.
- Relationships belonging to prims in instances that point to the root of the
  instance no longer cause errors.
- Value clip metadata can now be sparsely overridden across composition arcs.
- Deprecated shading property schemas UsdShadeParameter and 
  UsdShadeInterfaceAttribute. These are replaced by UsdShadeInput, which can
  represent both input parameters on shaders and interface inputs on node
  graphs.
- The `--compose` command line parameter for usddiff is now `--flatten`
- Numerous cleanup changes for Hydra API. In particular:
  - HdEngine::Draw has been retired in favor of HdEngine::Execute.
  - HdSceneDelegate::IsInCollection has been deprecated in favor of render-tag
    based API.

- The Maya plugin now excludes attributes during import if they are tagged
  with customData specifying them as generated.
- Numerous changes for ongoing Mac and Windows port efforts.
- Changed scoping of built-out point instancer prototypes in Katana plugin
  so that their hierarchy more closely matches the original USD hierarchy.

### Fixed
- Added workaround to avoid redefined "_XOPEN_SOURCE" and "_POSIX_C_SOURCE" 
  macro warnings due to Python includes on Linux. 
  (Issue: [#1](https://www.github.com/PixarAnimationStudios/USD/issues/1))
- Fixed issue where code would be generated directly into the install location 
  when running cmake, interfering with the use of make's DESTDIR functionality.

  same file might all be affected by the edits of one particular assembly 
  when viewing them via a proxy.
- Fixed issue in Maya plugin where path resolution was being done by the
  plugin itself rather than deferring to Usd and Sdf.

## [0.7.4] - 2017-03-03

USD now supports C++ namespaces. They are disabled by default in this release
to ease transition, but we anticipate enabling them by default in the next 
release. 

Specify the `PXR_ENABLE_NAMESPACES` CMake option to enable namespaces.
See documentation in [BUILDING.md](BUILDING.md#c-namespace-configuration) for more details.

### Added
- Added GfHalf type to represent half-precision numeric values. This type 
  is currently an alias to the "half" type supplied by the ilmbase library 
  USD is built against. This will be changed in an upcoming release to point 
  to a version of "half" that is included in the USD codebase, which will
  allow us to remove the USD core's dependency on ilmbase.
- Added UsdShadeInput class to represent shader or NodeGraph input.
  These are encoded as attributes in the "inputs:" namespace. By default, 
  this encoding will not be written out via UsdShadeConnectableAPI unless 
  the 'USD_SHADE_WRITE_NEW_ENCODING' environment variable is set.
- Added "Composition" tab to usdview that allows users to inspect the 
  composition structure of a selected prim.
- Added tests for Hdx. These tests are currently not run as part of the unit 
  test suite, but are being included for users to try on their platforms and 
  to serve as example code.
- Added icons for the USD assemblies in Maya.
- Added initial implementation of Katana plugin for reading 
  UsdGeomPointInstancer locations.

### Added
- Added support for RelWithDebInfo and MinSizeRel release types.
- Added initial support for C++ namespaces. This feature is 
  currently experimental but can be enabled by specifying the 
  `PXR_ENABLE_NAMESPACES` option to CMake. See documentation in
  BUILDING.md for more details.
- Added population masking to UsdStage. 
  - Consumers can specify what parts of a stage to populate and use
    to reduce resources used by the stage.

### Changed
- CMake will no longer look for X11 on OSX. 
  (Issue: [#72](https://www.github.com/PixarAnimationStudios/USD/issues/72))
- The build system now uses relative paths for baking in plugin
  search paths, allowing for relocatable builds as long as all
  build products are moved together as one unit.
- Removed hard-coded /usr/local/share directory from plugin search path.
- Optimized creation of prim specs in Sdf. Creating 100k prim specs 
  previously took 190s, it now takes 0.9s.
- SdfPath::GetVariantSelection now returns a variant selection only
  for variant selection paths.
- UsdStage no longer issues an error if requested to unload a path that
  does not identify an unloadable object.
- Changed API on UsdInherits, UsdReferences, UsdRelationship,
  UsdSpecializes, UsdVariantSet, and UsdVariantSets for clarity.
- Hydra GPU compute settings have been consolidated under a single
  HD_ENABLE_GPU_COMPUTE environment setting which is enabled by
  default if the OpenSubdiv being used supports the GLSL compute kernel.

## [0.7.2] - 2016-12-02

### Added
- Added ability to apply a custom prefix to shared library names
  by specifying the `PXR_LIB_PREFIX` option to CMake.
- Added ability to disable tests by using the `PXR_BUILD_TESTS` option
  with CMake.
- usddiff can now diff two directories containing USD files.
- Value clips on a prim may now be specified using 'template' clip
  metadata. This is a more compact representation for simple cases
  where each value clip corresponds to a single time code.
- Better support for non-file-backed asset resolution
  - Made ArDefaultResolver public, so that subclasses can layer
    behavior on top of it.
  - Added ArResolver API for retrieving files from data store when
    needed.
- Initial version of UsdGeomPointInstancer schema and preliminary
  support in usdImaging.
- pxrUsdReferenceAssemblies in Maya can now import animation from a USD scene.
  See http://openusd.org/docs/Maya-USD-Plugins.html#MayaUSDPlugins-ImportingasAssemblies 
  for details. 
- Core USD metadata (e.g. hidden, instanceable, kind) now roundtrips through 
  Maya, stored as "USD_XXX" attributes on corresponding Maya nodes.

### Changed
- Removed dependency on Qt. Note that PySide is still a dependency for 
  usdview.
  - Removed imaging/glfq library as part of this work.
- Modified variant behavior in composition:
  - Variants may now be nested within other variants in scene description.
    Nested variants may be authored by using nested UsdEditContext objects
    returned by UsdVariantSet::GetVariantEditContext.
  - Weaker variants may now introduce variant selections that affect
    stronger variants. Previously, these selections would be ignored 
    and the variant fallbacks would be used instead.
- Optimized .usdc file format performance in certain cases:
  - Output is buffered in memory to improve write times for layers 
    containing many nested dictionaries. In one such example, wall-clock
    time improved by ~64% and system time improved by 89%.
  - Time samples are now written out grouped by time to improve read 
    performance for frame-by-frame access patterns.
- Several optimizations to improve USD scenegraph authoring and composition 
  speed and reduce memory consumption. In some use cases, we observed:
  - ~5-7x less memory consumed by Pcp dependency tracking structures
  - ~40% less time spent to author large stages
- Exporting USD from the Maya Export window now produces binary .usd
  files by default instead of .usda files.

### Fixed
- Fixed bug where edits to a layer opened in Maya would persist when
  reopening that layer in a new scene.
- Fixed issue where exporting USD from the Maya Export window would
  produce files ending with ".usda", even if a different format
  was specified. The exporter should now respect any extension that
  is entered, so long as the "Default file extensions" option is
  turned off.
- Fixed several issues with example plugins being improperly built, making
  them unusuable, and missing functionality.
- Various other bug fixes and performance improvements.

## [0.7.1] - 2016-09-21

### Added
- UsdMaterial schema for shading, intended to replace UsdLook. Also added
  support for this new schema to Hydra.
- Initial version of UsdUI schema library, intended for encoding GUI 
  information on USD prims.
- Parallel teardown of some data members in UsdStage, speeding up overall
  teardown by ~2x.
- Support for packed vertex normals to Hydra, reducing GPU memory consumption
  by 20-30% in some cases.
- Ability to compare two composed stages to usddiff by specifying the
  "--compose" or "-c" options.
- Support for soft-selection for collapsed USD assemblies in Maya.
- Support for exporting color sets and UV sets as indexed primvars from Maya.

### Changed
- Refactored Hydra libraries to move higher-level concepts out of the core
  hd library and into hdx.
- Removed use of opensubdiv3/ include path from imaging code in favor of
  standard opensubdiv/ include.
- Modified UsdStage to automatically load newly-discovered payloads if
  their nearest ancestor's payload was also loaded. For example, consumers
  will no longer have to explicitly call UsdStage::Load to ensure payloads
  are loaded when switching variants on a prim, so long as their nearest
  ancestor is also loaded.
- Refactoring and other changes to help with Mac and Windows ports.
- Updated doxygen and other documentation.

### Fixed
- Fixed issue that caused Alembic plugin (usdAbc) to be misconfigured at
  build time, which required users to manually update its plugInfo.json
  and set an environment variable at runtime to make it work. This plugin
  is now installed to $PREFIX/plugin/usd/ and requires no additional
  steps to use once it has been built.
- Fixed issue with .usdc files that resulted in corrupted files on Windows.
  The file structure was changed, so the .usdc version has been bumped
  from 0.0.1 to 0.1.0. USD will continue to write 0.0.1 files by default,
  but will begin writing 0.1.0 files in the near future.

  Users may choose to write files with the new version immediately
  by setting the environment variable `USD_WRITE_NEW_USDC_FILES_AS_VERSION`
  to "0.1.0".

  Note that 0.0.1 files are still readable using this release, 
  except for those that have been generated on Windows using 0.7.0. 
  Early testers on Windows will need to regenerate those files
  with this release.
- Fixed issue that caused usdGenSchema to generate files that could
  not be compiled.
- Added a workaround for TBB-related issue in Maya that caused hangs when 
  using the USD Maya plugin. This can be enabled at build time by 
  specifying the `PXR_MAYA_TBB_BUG_WORKAROUND` option to CMake.
- Various other bug fixes and performance improvements.
