This library is included in the open source without build support (as it requires Qt).

Because it is an essential tool for developing against Hydra, a python implementation of this editor is included within usdview. While fully functional, its update performance is lower due to python overhead.

As such, this C++ version is intended as reference code or the starting point for inclusion within applications (either directly or wrapped as a whole to python).
