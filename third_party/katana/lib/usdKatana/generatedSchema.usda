        \"SetBaseMaterial()\"), it seems 
        natural to think about a \"child\" that inherits from its base Material 
        \"parent\".
        However, in USD, the derived Material cannot be a child of the base Material
        because the derives relationship would cause an infinite
        recursion in the composition graph (because the derived Material must
        inherit not just the base Material prim itself, but all of the shader and
        other prims scoped underneath it, which would include the derived Material
        itself).

        For UI's that want to present the hierarchy that derivation implies,
        we provide primName, which specifies the derived Material's 
        \"relative name\" with respect to the base Material.

        For example, a structure that looks like:
        - Metal
          - .. Brass
          - .. Aluminum

        will be encoded as
        - Metal
        - Metal_Brass
        - Metal_Aluminum

        We set derivedName on Metal_Brass and Metal_Aluminum to Brass and
        Aluminum, to be able to have proper child names if the hierarchy
        is reconstructed.
