// XXX What we're trying to do here has been described as "partial
//     composition" -- in the sense that we are trying to resolve
//     attributes and relationships in a way that temporarily
//     mutes any contributions from specialized classes, so that
//     we can represent the specializes hierarchy in a way that
//     exercises katana's namespace-style inheritance.
//
//     It seems likely that with more time/experience, we may
//     want to move some of this either into UsdShade API, or
//     directly into Usd in some form.  Consider this a first
//     step to demonstrate that we have the functional pieces
//     of a solution, leaving open the question of ideal API
//     for this sort of thing.

// Check if this attribute resolves from across a direct reference arc.

// Check if this prim is defined across a specializes arc.

// (Usd doesn't provide a UsdResolveInfo style API for asking where
// relationship targets are authored, so we do it here ourselves.)
