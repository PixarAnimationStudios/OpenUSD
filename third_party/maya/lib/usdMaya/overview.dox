USD support in Maya is provided through several libraries and plugins:
- \subpage usd_maya_lib_usdMaya_page_front
  This library provides reusable logic for using USD in Maya.
- \subpage usd_maya_plugin_pxrUsdTranslators_page_front
  This plugin supports the built-in Maya nodes.
- \subpage usd_maya_plugin_pxrUsd_page_front
  This is the main plugin that you load for USD functionality in Maya.
- \subpage usd_maya_plugin_pxrUsdPreviewSurface_page_front
  This is a Maya surface shader plugin node that mimics the UsdPreviewSurface shader in USD.

\mainpage UsdMaya : USD interop for Maya
\publicLib
\else
\page usd_maya_lib_usdMaya_page_front UsdMaya : USD interop for Maya
\endif

This library provides the core functionality for importing and exporting between
USD data in Maya. It also contains the logic for USD assembly references,
proxy shapes, and related Maya nodes.

## Translation Plugins

Plugins can provide new translation functions for USD types that are not built
into the core UsdMaya library. We ship plugins for the major Maya built-in node
types in the \ref usd_maya_plugin_pxrUsdTranslators_page_front
"pxrUsdTranslators Maya plugin".

When implementing new plugins, you must make sure to generate plugInfo.json
files, and that they are recognized by the Plug system. More details for
registering your plugins are available from these pages:

\sa UsdMayaPrimReaderRegistry
\sa UsdMayaPrimWriterRegistry

## Chaser Plugins

Plugins to the export process can be provided and enabled as needed. These
"chaser" plugins run after the main export process.

\sa UsdMayaChaserRegistry

## Shading Mode Plugins

You can provide custom plugins for importing and exporting Maya shading networks
to USD shading.

\sa UsdMayaShadingModeRegistry

## Adaptor System

UsdMaya provides the UsdMayaAdaptor class for adding schema data to Maya nodes
in a manner that is recognized by the USD export process. This lets you add
USD data, such as mesh subdivision scheme, onto Maya nodes and have that data
automatically exported to USD.

\sa UsdMayaAdaptor
