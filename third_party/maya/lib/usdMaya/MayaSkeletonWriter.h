/// Exports joint hierarchies (the hierarchies of DAG nodes rooted at a joint)
/// as a UsdSkelSkeleton, along with a UsdSkelPackedJointAnimation if the
/// joints are animated or posed differently from their rest pose. Currently,
/// each joint hierarchy is treated as a separate skeleton, meaning that this
/// prim writer will never produce skeletons with multiple root joints.
///
/// If the joints are posed differently from the rest pose on the export frame
/// (the current frame when the export command is run), a
/// UsdSkelPackedJointAnimation is created to encode the pose.
/// If the exportAnimation flag is enabled for the write job and the joints do
/// contain animation, then a UsdSkelPackedJointAnimation is created to encode
/// the joint animations.
///
/// UsdSkelSkeleton is not Xformable in the UsdSkel schema. Rather, the joint
/// transforms are encoded in attributes inside the Skeleton and the
/// PackedJointAnimation. Thus, a joint hierarchy in Maya will export as
/// a single UsdSkelSkeleton at its root joint, along with a child
/// PackedJointAnimation named "Animation" if necessary.
