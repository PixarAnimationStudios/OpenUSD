///
/// Typical usage is as follows:
///
/// Objects that manage drawing and selection of Maya shapes (e.g. classes
/// derived from \c MPxSurfaceShapeUI or \c MPxDrawOverride) should construct
/// and maintain a PxrMayaHdShapeAdapter. Those objects should call
/// AddShapeAdapter() to add their shape for batched drawing and selection.
///
/// In preparation for drawing, the shape adapter should be synchronized to
/// populate it with data from its shape and from the viewport display state.
/// A batch draw data object should also be created for the shape by calling
/// CreateBatchDrawData().
///
/// In the draw stage, Draw() must be called for each draw request to complete
/// the render.
///
/// Draw/selection management objects should be sure to call
/// RemoveShapeAdapter() (usually in the destructor) when they no longer wish
/// for their shape to participate in batched drawing and selection.
