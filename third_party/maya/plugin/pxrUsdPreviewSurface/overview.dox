## Overview

This plugin contains a "pxrUsdPreviewSurface" Maya shader node that provides
the Maya-side equivalent of the UsdPreviewSurface shader in USD. The Maya
shader has all of the same attributes as UsdPreviewSurface, and in fact uses
much of the same code.

The shader executes in Viewport 2.0 using Maya's fragment graph system. The
fragment graph and the fragment XML files used by the surfacing shading
node override are generated by the pxrUsdPreviewSurfaceGenFragments script, a
typical invocation of which might look like this:

    pxrUsdPreviewSurfaceGenFragments \
        ../../../../pxr/usdImaging/lib/usdShaders/shaders/previewSurface.glslfx \
        --schema <Maya installation dir>/bin/ShadeFragment/v2pFragment.xsd

This script will lift the lighting and material-specific portions of shading
code from the provided path to the preview surface glslfx file. It will
also use the template XML and _shaderCode.glsl files in the source
directory to generate the final XML files for installation.

This generation script is also tied into the build system to run in a
validation mode when the plugin is built and ensure that the XML files are
up-to-date.
