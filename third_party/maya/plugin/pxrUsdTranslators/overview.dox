## Overview

The \c pxrUsdTranslators Maya plugin provides the USD importers and exporters
for built-in Maya nodes. It also provides an example for users who are trying
to implement their own custom USD importers or exporters.

It registers itself via the plugin mechanism used by the
\ref usd_maya_lib_usdMaya_page_front "UsdMaya library" so that the import and
export functionality is available to all UsdMaya clients, such as the \c pxrUsd
plugin. It doesn't directly expose any public APIs.

You don't have to load the \c pxrUsdTranslators plugin manually. It will
automatically be loaded by UsdMaya when needed.

## Coding Conventions

- Importer plugins have the file name <tt>[usdTypeName]Reader</tt>, and any
  importer classes are named <tt>PxrUsdTranslators_[usdTypeName]Reader</tt>.
- Exporter plugins have the file name <tt>[mayaTypeName]Writer</tt>, and any
  exporter classes are named <tt>PxrUsdTranslators_[mayaTypeName]Writer</tt>.
