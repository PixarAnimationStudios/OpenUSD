## Overview

This is the main plugin that registers USD functionality in Maya, including
import and export commands, as well as USD nodes such as the reference assembly
and proxy shape.

The core reusable logic is implemented in the
\ref usd_maya_lib_usdMaya_page_front "UsdMaya library". Translation
functionality for built-in Maya types is automatically loaded from the
\ref usd_maya_plugin_pxrUsdTranslators_page_front "pxrUsdTranslators plugin"
when needed.
