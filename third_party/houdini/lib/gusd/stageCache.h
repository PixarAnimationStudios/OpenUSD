    /// propopagation will be isolated only to stages of the stage cache

    /// as sublayers and reference arcs -- are shared on a global cache.

    /// edits has already been loaded on the cache, the prim will fetched from

    /// to that external prim must be discoverable using either relationships
    /// or attribute connections.
    /// Following those encapsulation rules, neither _siblings_ of the prim
    /// being requested, or other prims in separate branches of the stage
    /// are guaranteed to be loaded. Any attempt to reach other prims that
    /// can't be discovered using the above rules for discovering dependencies
