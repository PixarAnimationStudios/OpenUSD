12. Injunctive Relief. You acknowledge and agree that your breach of this
    Agreement, including any unauthorized use, transfer, distribution,
    sublicensing, or disclosure of the USD ASSET or any Derivative Works will
    cause irreparable injury to Pixar and/or its licensors, and under such
    circumstances, Pixar and/or its licensors shall be entitled to equitable
    relief, including without limitation preliminary and permanent injunctive
    relief, without being required to present evidence of such irreparable
    harm. You further acknowledge and agree that Pixar and/or its licensors
    shall be entitled to such equitable relief without being required to post a
    bond or other security.

13. Relationship of Parties. The parties hereunder are independent contractors
    and this Agreement will not establish any relationship of partnership, joint
    venture, employment, franchise, or agency between You and Pixar. Neither
    party will have the power to bind the other or incur obligations on the
    other's behalf without the other's prior written consent, except as
    otherwise expressly provided herein.

14. Assignment. You may not assign Your rights or delegate Your duties under
    this Agreement either in whole or in part, whether by merger,
    reorganization, sale of stock or assets, operation of law, or otherwise,
    without the prior written consent of Pixar. Any attempted assignment or
    delegation without such consent will be void. Pixar may assign its rights
    and obligations hereunder without restriction.

15. Waiver. No waiver of any provision of this Agreement by us shall be deemed a
    further or continuing waiver of such provision or any other provision, and
    our failure to assert any right or provision under this Agreement shall not
    constitute a waiver of such right or provision.

16. Entire Agreement. The terms of this Agreement shall be governed by and
    construed in accordance with the laws of the State of California, without
    giving effect to any principles of conflicts of law. You agree that any
    action at law or in equity arising out of or relating to this Agreement
    shall be filed only in the state or federal courts located in the city and
    county of San Francisco, California, and you hereby consent and submit to
    the personal jurisdiction of such courts for the purposes of litigating any
    such action. If any provision of these terms shall be unlawful, void, or for
    any reason unenforceable, then that provision shall be deemed severable from
    these terms and shall not affect the validity and enforceability of any
    remaining provisions. This Agreement supersedes in full all prior
    discussions and agreements between the parties relating to the subject
    matter hereof, and constitutes the entire agreement between the parties
    relating to the subject matter hereof. Pixar reserves the right to update,
    in its sole discretion, this Agreement at any time. Any such updates to the
    Agreement will be posted to the applicable Pixar website. Your continued use
    of the USD ASSET and/or any Derivative Works following posting by Pixar of
    the updated Agreement indicates your acceptance of the updated
    Agreement. Except for Pixar's right to update this Agreement as specified in
    this section, any modifications to this Agreement must be made in writing
    and signed by both parties.
