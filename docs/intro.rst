What is USD?
============

Pipelines capable of producing computer graphics films and games typically
generate, store, and transmit large quantities of 3D data, which we call
"scene description". Each of many cooperating applications in the pipeline
(modeling, shading, animation, lighting, fx, rendering) typically has its own
special form of scene description tailored to the specific needs and
workflows of the application, which is neither readable nor editable by any
other application.  **Universal Scene Description (USD) is the first publicly
available software that addresses the need to robustly and scalably
interchange and augment arbitrary 3D scenes that may be** :bi:`composed`
**from many elemental assets.** 

USD provides for interchange of elemental assets (e.g. models) or
animations. But unlike other interchange packages, USD also enables assembly
and organization of any number of assets into virtual sets, scenes, shots,
and worlds, transmitting them from application to application, and
non-destructively editing them (as *overrides*), with a single, consistent
API, in a single scenegraph. USD provides a :doc:`rich toolset <toolset>` for
reading, writing, editing, and rapidly previewing 3D geometry, shading,
lighting, physics, and a growing number of other graphics-related domains.
In addition, because USD's core scenegraph and :ref:`composition engine
<glossary:Composition>` are agnostic of any particular domain, USD can be
extended in a maintainable way to encode and compose data in other domains.

Concretely, USD is an `open source project
<https://github.com/PixarAnimationStudios/USD>`_ released under a `modified
Apache license
<https://github.com/PixarAnimationStudios/USD/blob/release/LICENSE.txt>`_.

Why use USD?
============

USD is the core of Pixar's 3D graphics pipeline, used in every 3D authoring and
rendering application, including Pixar's proprietary *Presto* animation
system. Pixar is deeply committed to evolving and improving USD to address the
following ongoing production concerns:

    * **Provide a rich, common language for defining, packaging, assembling, and
      editing 3D data, facilitating the use of multiple digital content creation
      applications.**

      Like many other interchange packages, USD provides a low-level data
      model that stipulates, at a "file format level", how data is encoded
      and organized, plus a (extensible) set of high-level schemas that
      provide meaningful API's and organization for concepts like :usdcpp:`a
      mesh <UsdGeomMesh>` or :usdcpp:`a transform <UsdGeomXformable>`.
      With such a foundation one can create asset definitions with
      geometric, material, lighting, and other properties. But USD goes
      further to provide a freely combinable set of :ref:`glossary:Composition
      Arcs` that can be used to package, aggregate, vary, and override
      primitive elements and assets, with a high-performance runtime
      evaluation engine, embodied in a compact scenegraph known as a
      :ref:`glossary:Stage`, for resolving the resulting :ref:`composed
      scene description<glossary:Composition>` and extracting (and
      authoring) data from it.

    * **Allow multiple artists to collaborate on the same assets and scenes.**

      USD's most basic composition arc, :ref:`the subLayers operator
      <glossary:SubLayers>`, facilitates multiple artists in different
      departments, or within the same department, to simultaneously work on
      the same asset or scene, by allowing each artist to work in their own
      file (called a :ref:`glossary:Layer`), all of which will be combined
      and resolved in a :ref:`strength ordering <glossary:LIVRPS Strength
      Ordering>` clearly specified in the USD files themselves. This ability
      is not a magic bullet that can automatically adjust shading data in a
      stronger layer when the modeling artist changes the topology of
      geometry defined in a weaker layer, but it allows each artist to work
      independently without erasing or editing any other artist's work, and
      helps to provide a clear audit trail of changes that aids in addressing
      problems like the changing-topology problem.

    * **Maximize artistic iteration by minimizing latency.** 

      As in many media, one of the most important ingredients to achieving
      high-quality digital art is the ability to iterate quickly and often on a
      design, an asset, an animation. One of the most prominent impediments to
      iteration in 3D art is the speed with which an artist can get "good
      enough" visual feedback on the results of their edits, and the speed with
      which they can migrate new data between multiple applications, or restore
      a session that has crashed. Speed is a primary, ongoing goal of the USD
      project at Pixar; we continue to explore algorithmic improvements, better
      ways to leverage modern multi-core systems and GPU's, and compression
      techniques to minimize latency in accessing remotely stored data.

If your needs are similar to or are a subset of the above, then USD may be an
attractive choice.

What can USD do?
================

USD can represent:
******************

USD organizes data into hierarchical namespaces of :ref:`Prims
<glossary:Prim>` (short for "primitive"). In addition to child prims, each
prim can contain :ref:`Attributes <glossary:Attribute>` and
:ref:`Relationships <glossary:Relationship>`, collectively known as
:ref:`Properties <glossary:Property>`.  Attributes have `typed values
<api/_usd__page__datatypes.html>`_ that
can vary over time; Relationships are multi-target "pointers" to other
objects in a hierarchy, and USD takes care of remapping the targets
automatically when referencing causes namespaces to change. Both prims and
properties can also have (non-time-varying) metadata. Prims and their
contents are organized into a file abstraction known as a
:ref:`glossary:Layer`.

Built on top of this low-level, generic scene description, USD provides a set of
schemas that establish a standard encoding and client API for common 3D computer
graphics concepts like:

Geometry 
      The `UsdGeom schemas
      <api/usd_geom_page_front.html>`_ 
      define `OpenSubdiv <https://graphics.pixar.com/opensubdiv/docs/intro.html>`_
      -compliant meshes, transforms, curves, points, nurbs patches, and
      several intrinsic solids. It also defines: the concept of arbitrary
      :ref:`primvars <glossary:Primvar>` as attributes that can interpolate
      across a geometric surface; geometric extents and aggregate, computed
      bounding boxes; :ref:`pruning visibility<glossary:Visibility>`; and
      an attribute called :ref:`glossary:Purpose` that expresses a
      (non-animatable) conditional visibility useful for deploying
      level-of-detail proxies and guides.

Shading 
      The `UsdShade schemas
      <api/usd_shade_page_front.html>`_
      define primitive shader nodes that can be connected into networks and
      packaged into reusable materials, on which one can create a public
      interface of attributes that will drive parameters in the contained
      shader networks. UsdShade also provides flexible mechanisms for
      *binding* geometry to materials so as to define their lighting response
      (and physics) characteristics.

Model and Asset
      USD's composition operators allow you to construct arbitrarily large,
      complex scenes. As an aid to processing, analyzing, and decomposing
      such scenes, USD formalizes the concepts of :ref:`glossary:Model` and
      :ref:`glossary:Asset`. The "model" prim classification allows
      scenegraphs to be partitioned into logical, manageable chunks for
      traversal, working-set management, and data coalescing/caching. The
      concept of "asset" shows up in USD at two levels: as a core datatype
      for referring unambiguously to an external file, identifying which data
      needs to participate in :ref:`asset/path resolution <glossary:Asset
      Resolution>`; and in the :ref:`glossary:AssetInfo` schema for
      depositing a record of what assets have been referenced into a scene,
      which survives even if the scene is :ref:`flattened
      <glossary:Flatten>`.

USD can compose and override:
*****************************

The following is a very compact description of USD's composition semantics, with
links to more detailed descriptions.

You can "stack" USD layers together using the :ref:`subLayers composition arc
<glossary:SubLayers>`, and the composition engine will resolve the data
contained in such ordered (nestable) :ref:`"LayerStacks"
<glossary:LayerStack>` similarly to how layers in Photoshop are composed.

Any prim in a layer can also contain one or more :ref:`references composition
arcs<glossary:References>` that target a prim in another (or the same!)
layer, and composes the tree rooted at the target prim into the referencing
prim - this is the primary way to assemble elemental assets into aggregates
and complete scenes. The :ref:`payload arc<glossary:payload>` provides a
"deferred reference" that can be selectively "loaded" (or unloaded) from a
:ref:`glossary:Stage` *after* the stage was initially opened; judicious use
of payloads allows you to structure scenes so that clients can easily manage
"working sets", keeping in memory just the parts of the scene they need for
the task at hand.

:ref:`VariantSets<glossary:VariantSet>` allow an asset *creator* to bundle
different multiple variations of an asset all into a single package with a
"variant selector" that downstream asset *consumers* can switch,
non-destructively, in stronger layers to change the variation they desire;
any prim can define multiple VariantSets, which can vary along dependent or
independent axes.

The last two composition arcs, :ref:`inherits<glossary:Inherits>`
and :ref:`specializes<glossary:Specializes>` both
establish a persistent (across further, upstream composition arcs) relationship
between a "base" prim and a "derived" prim, such that the derived prim receives
all of the overrides applied to the base prim anywhere in the composition; the
technical difference between :usda:`inherits` and :usda:`specializes` lies in 
the particulars of when derived's opinions "win out" over base's opinions, but
practically the difference is: you can use :usda:`inherits` to easily "mass 
edit" all instances of a particular class of prim or asset, and you can use 
:usda:`specializes` to create a "derived" that is always a "specialized" 
refinement of "base" in all views of your scene.

The most powerful and unifying aspect of USD's composition semantics is that all
of the above operators can be applied to any prim, in any combination, and the
composition engine will :ref:`resolve the resulting graph in a predictable way
<glossary:LIVRPS Strength Ordering>`. The other desirable
property that falls out of this uniform treatment of composition arcs is that
stronger layers in a composition can override the scene description in weaker
layers *uniformly*, regardless of whether the weaker layers were subLayered,
referenced, inherited, etc. A stronger layer can override the following with
respect to weaker layers:

    * **Add new prims** including entire subtrees rooted at the added prim

    * :ref:`Deactivate<glossary:Active / Inactive>` prims , which is
      USD's method for non-destructive (and reversible) prim/subtree deletion

    * **Reorder prims**, since in some contexts, the namespace-ordering can be
      meaningful

    * **Add or remove** :ref:`Variants<glossary:Variant>` to an existing
      VariantSet

    * **Add or remove entire VariantSets**, or targets to inherit or specialize

    * **Override the value of schema and user-level metadata** on a prim or
      property

    * **Add new properties** to a prim

    * **Reorder properties** on a prim. If not explicitly ordered, properties
      are enumerated in dictionary order

    * **Override the value of any attribute** (an override value blocks all
      weaker timeSamples)

    * :ref:`Block the value<glossary:Attribute Block>` of an
      attribute, so that it will appear to have no authored value

    * **Add, remove, and reorder targets on a relationship or attribute
      connection**

Finally, USD provides a handful of scenegraph-level features that can greatly
expand the types and scale of datasets encodable in USD. The two most
prominent are :ref:`native prim Instancing<glossary:Instancing>` for very
compactly encoding (and processing) large numbers of instances/copies of a
referenced asset or prim, applicable when the copies do not need to be deeply
edited; and :ref:`glossary:Value Clips`, which allow timeSamples for a set of
prims to be distributed across many files, and (re-)sequenced and retimed
non-destructively.

USD/Hydra can image:
********************

:ref:`glossary:Hydra` is the imaging framework that ships as part of the USD
distribution. It connects "scene delegates" (that consume scene data) and
"render delegates" (that send the scene data to particular renderers), in such
a way that render and scene delegates can be mixed and matched as
applications and consumers' needs dictate. Hydra's first and primary render
delegate is the rasterizing **Storm** renderer, which began as a modern
OpenGL renderer, and which has now incorporated a "graphics interface"
abstraction that allows Storm to use Vulkan, Metal, and potentially other
rasterizing rendering API's.  Storm is highly scalable, multi-pass, and uses
`OpenSubdiv <https://graphics.pixar.com/opensubdiv/docs/intro.html>`_ for
mesh rendering. The repository also includes with a simple `Embree
<https://embree.github.io/>`_ -based path tracer to serve as an example for
creating more backends, and HdPrman, which is evolving into the definitive
means of rendering USD with `Pixar's premiere RenderMan renderer
<https://renderman.pixar.com>`_.

The USD scene delegate to Hydra is used in :ref:`toolset:usdview` and nearly
all third-party plugins that integrate USD, and is meant to provide a "ground
truth" rendering of any scene composed of prims conforming to the `UsdGeom
schemas <api/usd_geom_page_front.html>`_,
UsdShade, UsdVol, UsdSkel, UsdLux, and other graphics-related schema
domains. It also provides fast preview and animation streaming for USD
scenes.

USD can be extended/customized:
*******************************

Even though USD is primarily used as an embedded sub-system, the breadth of
the problem-space it covers demands that it be extensible along a number of
axes. USD comes with its own `plugin discovery mechanism
<api/plug_page_front.html>`_, and the
following plugin-points:

    * **Asset Resolution**  
      
      In a highly-referenced scene, it can be advantageous to have a degree
      of separation between the asset paths recorded in the USD files and the
      "resolved locator/identifier" from which the asset will ultimately be
      loaded. The :usdcpp:`ArResolver` interface can be customized per USD
      installation and per "plugin package", allowing, for example,
      site-specific naming conventions to be resolved, and for dynamic
      versioning control to be applied. USD ships with a default resolver
      implementation that allows for simple "search-path" style asset resolution
      for traditional filesystems.
      
      However, the Ar system allows for the coexistence of multiple,
      URI-protocol-dispatched resolvers, each of which can resolve asset
      paths to :usdcpp:`ArAsset` that can stream data directly from clouds or 
      databases, or even construct assets procedurally, in-memory.

    * **File Formats** 

      A USD Layer can be taught to be populated with data translated from any
      kind of compatible file format, by implementing an :usdcpp:`SdfFileFormat`
      plugin for the format. USD's own native *usda* (text), *usdc* (binary),
      and *usdz* (packaged archive) formats are implemented this way, as is the
      included support for reading Alembic files via the :doc:`Alembic USD
      Plugin <plugins_alembic>`, as well as `MaterialX xml files
      <api/usd_mtlx_page_front.html>`_.
      
      File formats can also be "dynamic", such that when referenced into a 
      scene via a :ref:`payload arc<glossary:Payload>`, modifiable metadata
      parameters on the payloaded prim are transmitted to the file format
      plugin which is then allowed to re-evaluate itself. This allows for a
      degree of user-directed proceduralism.

    * **Schemas**  

      USD includes :doc:`a tool for generating new schemas
      <tut_generating_new_schema>` (C++ classes, python bindings, and all
      required boilerplate) from a simple usda text description of the
      schema. This can be used to add new USD prim schema types and API's to
      your pipeline or package, with which you will be able to interact in your
      application-level plugins just as if they were native USD schemas. For
      typed schemas that are conceptually imageable, you can also teach Hydra
      how to image them.

What can't USD do?
==================

No GUIDS
********

USD uses a textual, hierarchical namespace to identify its data, which means it
is "namespace paths" by which overrides bind to their defining
prims/properties. In consequence, when the internal namespace of a referenced
asset changes, *higher-level overrides previously recorded in referencing assets
will fall off*. One solution to this problem is to identify data by a
"globally unique identifer" (GUID), and then associate overrides with the same
GUID as the defining prim. While solving the namespace-editing problem, GUIDs
introduce other problems into a pipeline, and potentially limitations on
flexibility of composition. In past iterations of USD, Pixar used a form of
GUID at the model/asset granularity, and after carefully weighing the pros and
cons, we have decided that for us, the cost of occasional "namespace fix-up"
operations run over a collection of assets is worth paying for the ease of asset
construction and aggregation, and readable text asset representations that we
get from namespace-paths as identifiers.

Not an execution or rigging system
**********************************

USD provides a lightweight, optimized scenegraph to facilitate authoring and
efficient extraction of composed scene description. However, it provides no
other behaviors than composition of a namespace hierarchy and property
:ref:`glossary:Value Resolution`, and in the tradeoff space between "low-memory
footprint, higher-latency data access" and "high-memory footprint, low-latency
access to data", USD's scenegraph leans more towards the former, whereas a
high-performance execution engine requires the latter.

Further, the more rigging behaviors and execution semantics we would add to USD,
the more difficult it would become to interchange the data successfully between
DCC's, since there is not, currently, broad agreement between vendors of what
these behaviors should be.

USD and its schema generation tools should be suitable for encoding rigging for
round-tripping rigging data in a particular application or custom pipeline, and
USD does provide facilities that a client could use to build more extensive
in-memory caches on top of a UsdStage to provide lower-latency access to data
encoded in USD. But for now, these do not play a significant role in what we
feel is the primary directive of USD: scalable interchange of geometric,
shading, and lighting data between DCC's in a 3D content creation pipeline.


Heritage of USD at Pixar
========================

USD is roughly the fourth generation of "composed scene description" developed
at Pixar. After muscling through `Toy Story
<https://www.pixar.com/feature-films/toy-story>`_, in which each shot was
described by a single, linear program file, the Pixar R&D team began adding and
evolving concepts for referencing, layering, editing, and variation in the
context of its proprietary animation system, *Marionette* (known internally as
Menv), beginning with `A Bug's Life
<https://www.pixar.com/feature-films/a-bugs-life>`_, and continuing over the
course of the next ten feature films.

By 2004 it was clear that, although Marionette had grown quite powerful, its
organically evolved provenance was becoming a hindrance to continued stable
development and our ability to leverage important tools like multi-core
systems. The studio committed to the design and development of a ground-up,
second-generation animation system now known as *Presto*, which was first used
on `Brave <https://www.pixar.com/feature-films/brave>`_ and all features
since. One of the problems with Marionette that Presto set out to address was
that its various features for composing and overriding 3D scene description
could not always be used together effectively, because they were spread across
three different formats and "composition engines". Presto delivered a second
generation of scene description that was *unified*, enabling referencing,
overriding, variation, and other operations at all granularities from a single
mesh, to an entire model, to an environment or shot, encoded in a single text
format and evaluated with a single composition engine.

However, at the same time, Pixar, along with much of the film and effects
industry, found it advantageous to transition from a pipeline in which animation
and rigging were kept live up until rendering, to one in which animation and
rigs were baked out into efficient "pose caches" containing animated posed
points and transforms, so that lighting, effects, and rendering could reduce the
latency (and memory footprint) with which they can access the
data. Consequently, in 2008-2009, the pipeline development team began building
*TidScene*, a geometry schema backed by a binary database (Berkeley DB), with a
lightweight scenegraph as the mechanism for authoring and reading time-sampled
data. Key elements of TidScene included a (for the time) high performance
OpenGL rendering plugin that enabled direct-from-TidScene preview rendering in
all pipeline applications, and the development of a native referencing feature
that was used (possibly abused) to achieve layering, scenegraph "isolation"
(i.e. loading only a portion of the scene), asset referencing, and some support
for variation.

The speed, scalability, and universal pipeline access of TidScene pose-caches
were a success, but also put Pixar back into a place where we had multiple,
competing systems for creating composed scene description, with different
semantics, API's, and places in the pipeline where they could be used. The
mandate for the USD project, initiated in 2012, was to marry the (recently
redesigned and improved) composition engine and low-level data model from Presto
with the lazy-access, time-sampled data model and lightweight scenegraph from
TidScene. USD delivers an all-new scenegraph that sits on top of the very same
composition engine that Presto uses, and has introduced parallel computation
into all levels of the scene description and composition core.

A key component of the USD project was the development of a modern, scalable
rendering architecture, dubbed *Hydra*, initially deployed with what would
become known as the Storm high-performance rasterizing renderer. Hydra ships
as part of the USD project because it adds tremendous value to USD adoption
in a pipeline and is used in all our plugins; it also provides a benchmark
and reference for how to leverage USD's multithreading for fast scene loading
and imaging, as well as updating efficiently in response to dynamic edits to
a live UsdStage. However, Hydra is a product in its own right, and already
has other direct front-end couplings other than USD (including Presto and
Maya, Katana, and Houdini plugins), and has grown beyond its original
OpenGL-inspired architecture to service other render delegates, such as
path-tracers.
