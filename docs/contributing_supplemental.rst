===================

By and in consideration for using a Pixar site (e.g., Pixar's OpenUSD-proposals
site), providing Submissions to Pixar, or by clicking a box that states that
you accept or agree to these terms, you signify your agreement to these
Supplemental Terms.

You hereby grant to Pixar and our licensees, distributors, agents,
representatives and other authorized users, a perpetual, non-exclusive,
irrevocable, fully-paid, royalty-free, sub-licensable and transferable
(in whole or part) worldwide license under all copyrights, trademarks, patents,
trade secret rights, data rights, privacy and publicity rights and other
proprietary rights you or your affiliates now or hereafter own or control, to
reproduce, transmit, display, exhibit, distribute, index, comment on, perform,
create derivative works based upon, modify, make, use, sell, have made, import,
and otherwise exploit in any manner, the Submissions and any implementations of
the Submissions, in whole or in part, including in all media formats and
channels now known or hereafter devised, for any and all purposes, including
entertainment, research, news, advertising, promotional, marketing, publicity,
trade or commercial purposes, all without further notice to you, with or without
attribution, and without the requirement of any permission from or payment to
you or any other person or entity.  

As used herein, Submissions shall mean any text, proposals, white papers,
specifications, messages, technologies, ideas, concepts, pitches, suggestions,
stories, screenplays, treatments, formats, artwork, photographs, drawings,
videos, audiovisual works, musical compositions (including lyrics), sound
recordings, characterizations, software code, algorithms, structures, your
and/or other persons' names, likenesses, voices, usernames, profiles, actions,
appearances, performances and/or other biographical information or material,
and/or other similar materials that you submit, post, upload, embed, display,
communicate or otherwise distribute to or for Pixar or a Pixar site.

These Supplemental Terms are in addition to any prior or contemporaneous
agreement (and shall remain in effect notwithstanding any future agreement)
that you may have with Pixar.

At any time, we may update these Supplemental Terms (including by modification,
deletion and/or addition of any portion thereof).  Any update to these
Supplemental Terms will be effective thirty (30) calendar days following our
posting of the updated Supplemental Terms to a Pixar site.
