USD Contributors
================

The following list is almost certainly incomplete, but is an attempt to credit
all the folks who have contributed not just code but ideas to the evolution of
scene description that is today embodied in USD, between 1995 and 2019 at Pixar,
as well as all the contributors of pull requests we have accepted. If you think
you should be on this list, please let us know! In addition to the folks listed
below who have contributed code or direct support, we would especially and
specifically like to thank the Pixar leadership for their forward-thinking and
support for allowing and encouraging the USD project to be open-sourced,
including Ed Catmull, Jim Morris, Steve May, and Guido Quaroni. Guido provided
the initial proposition and challenge for creating USD, and Bill Polson navigated
the sea of patents we needed to release to make USD public.
