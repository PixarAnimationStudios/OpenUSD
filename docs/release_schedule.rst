================

Pixar publishes USD releases on a semi-regular cadence. 

Pixar publishes dev releases approximately weekly. Dev releases get published to
the 
`dev branch of the github OpenUSD repo <https://github.com/PixarAnimationStudios/OpenUSD/tree/dev>`__ 
and documentation is published to 
`openusd.org (dev version) <https://openusd.org/dev/index.html>`__.

Pixar publishes full releases approximately quarterly. Full releases get 
published to the 
`release branch of the github OpenUSD repo <https://github.com/PixarAnimationStudios/OpenUSD/tree/release>`__ 
and documentation is published to 
`openusd.org (release version) <https://openusd.org/release/index.html>`__. 
Pixar publishes at least one release candidate for early testing 
approximately a week prior to publishing the official full release, with 
additional release candidates published if any show-stopping bugs are found.

Release schedules and dates are subject to change, see the 
`Announcements channel <https://forum.aousd.org/c/general/announcements/5>`__
