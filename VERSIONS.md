3rd Party Library and Application Versions
------------------------------------------

USD relies on an ecosystem of libraries and applications.  This page outlines
the versions of these libraries used and tested against at Pixar as well as
ones that have been tried by others.

Note that not everything here is required, see README.md for more information
about which are required and which are optional for the various subsystems.
